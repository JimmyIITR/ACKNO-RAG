Fact check: Mostly False. While marijuana may have a lower potential for addiction compared to alcohol and tobacco, this statement is not completely accurate. The level of addiction varies for different individuals and types of substances, and marijuana can still be addictive for some people. Additionally, it is important to consider other factors such as the frequency of use and method of consumption when discussing addiction potential.

False. While it is true that the US has made progress in reducing carbon emissions, it is not ahead of ""other parts of the world"" as claimed.

According to Politifact's investigation, this statement is not factually correct. There is no evidence to suggest that President Obama is trying to ""pack"" the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.

False,"""Puerto Rico mayor facing fraud charges over $3M in federal disaster relief""",https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2018/jul/19/blog-posting/misleading-article-implies-puerto-rico-hurricane-a/,"
Given social media post is not sufficient information to determine if it is factually correct. The post references a blog post by Bloggers from July 15, 2018, which states that the mayor of Puerto Rico is facing fraud charges over $3 million in federal disaster relief. However, further context and evidence is needed to verify this claim, such as official charges or statements from the mayor or government officials. Additionally, other news sources have reported accusations of misuse of funds by Puerto Rican officials, but it is not clear if these allegations are specifically related to the mayor in question. In order to determine the accuracy of the post, it would be necessary to consult multiple sources and gather more information on the situation."
