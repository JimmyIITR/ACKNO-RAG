Here’s a summary of the provided text, formatted into approximately ten paragraphs, aiming for a natural flow and retaining key information:

The core of this analysis centers around a fact-checking investigation conducted by Africa Check regarding eight claims made by Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari concerning his administration’s achievements. The initial report, framed by the headline “Claim Eight claims about current government achievements. Verdict A range of ratings from correct to misleading and unproven,” establishes the context: a critical assessment of the President’s statements. This investigation highlights a growing need for independent scrutiny of public pronouncements, particularly within politically charged environments.

Africa Check, operating as an independent and non-partisan organization, undertook this fact-checking process, emphasizing its commitment to holding public figures accountable. The organization’s methodology is rooted in established journalistic standards, prioritizing thorough investigation, rigorous verification, and meticulous sourcing of information. This approach underscores the importance of a skeptical and evidence-based approach to evaluating claims, particularly those made by those in positions of power.

The fact-checking process relied on a combination of readily available online tools, direct reader input, and consultation with relevant experts. This multi-faceted approach demonstrates a commitment to utilizing a diverse range of resources to arrive at a reliable assessment. The organization’s reliance on both quantitative and qualitative data strengthens the credibility of their findings.

A key element of Africa Check’s methodology is its clear and transparent rating system – classifying claims as “correct,” “misleading,” or “unproven.” This system provides a readily understandable framework for communicating the results of their investigation to the public. The use of these distinct categories facilitates a nuanced understanding of the veracity of each claim.

The overarching theme of this project is accountability. Africa Check’s work directly addresses the challenge of misinformation and disinformation, actively working to combat the spread of inaccurate information within the public sphere. This is particularly relevant in a context where claims made by political leaders can significantly influence public opinion and policy decisions.

The investigation’s significance extends beyond simply debunking specific claims. It implicitly argues for the vital role of independent fact-checking organizations in a healthy democratic society. By providing a reliable source of information, Africa Check contributes to informed public discourse and promotes responsible governance.

The text suggests potential applications for this case study, including its use as an educational resource in media literacy programs, journalism training, and civic engagement initiatives. The detailed methodology could be adapted into training materials for journalists and researchers.

Furthermore, the information could be incorporated directly into Africa Check’s website, offering a clear explanation of their processes and findings. The core message – the importance of critical thinking and fact-checking – could also be effectively communicated through social media content.

However, the current summary is limited by the lack of detail. Crucially, the full list of the eight claims remains unknown, and the specific reasoning behind each rating – “correct,” “misleading,” or “unproven” – is absent.  Access to this granular information is essential for a complete understanding of the investigation’s scope and conclusions.

Ultimately, this text represents a valuable example of a robust fact-checking project, highlighting the importance of independent verification and the potential for organizations like Africa Check to play a crucial role in safeguarding the integrity of public discourse.  Further research would undoubtedly benefit from access to the complete claim list and the detailed rationale behind the assigned ratings.Trump Tax Cuts 2025: Budget Reconciliation | Tax Foundation Skip to content U.S. Europe EN Subscribe Donate Research Research Areas Federal Tax State Tax Global Tax EU Tax All Research Meet Our Experts Featured Projects TCJA Expirations Options TCJA Tax Calculator Budget Reconciliation Tracker Tariff Tracker Growth and Opportunity Tax Plan Federal Tax Modeling State Reforms for Mobility and Modernization State Tax Competitiveness Index International Tax Competitiveness Index European Tax Policy Scorecard Featured Issues Tariffs & Trade Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Expirations Property Taxes Global Tax Deal Debt & Deficits Cost Recovery Taxes on Savers & Investors State Tax Trends Latest Research Trump Tariffs: Tracking the Economic Impact of the Trump Trade War 33 min read Experts Data Data Areas Federal Tax State Tax Global Tax EU Tax All Data Meet Our Experts Featured Projects Facts & Figures: How Does Your State Compare?

This update adds details regarding the Trump administration’s tariff actions. This update provides details on the House adoption of the Senate-amended budget resolution. See Full Timeline Key Findings Extending the expiring 2017 Tax A tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local, state, and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services, goods, and activities. Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA ) would decrease federal tax revenue by $4.5 trillion from 2025 through 2034. Long-run GDP would be 1.1 percent higher, offsetting $710 billion, or 16 percent , of the revenue losses. Long-run GNP (a measure of American incomes) would only rise by 0.4 percent, as some of the benefits of the tax cuts and larger economy go to foreigners in the form of higher interest payments on the debt. President Trump has called for permanent extension of the 2017 tax cuts, additional policies— including no taxes on tips , overtime pay , and Social Security benefits for retirees—as well as creation of a deduction for auto loan interest for American made cars. He has also promised higher taxes on US imports through a series of new tariffs . Lawmakers will use the budget reconciliation process to enact new tax cuts. Reconciliation is a fast-track option that overcomes the Senate filibuster and can be used to enact tax, spending, and debt limit changes outlined in a budget resolution with specified targets or limits for deficit changes within the budget window. Separately from the reconciliation process in Congress, President Trump is imposing tariffs that will raise revenue and reduce economic output. The Latest May 13, 2025 : We estimate the House GOP’s “One Big Beautiful” tax bill under markup would increase long-run GDP by 0.6 percent and reduce federal tax revenue by $4.0 trillion from 2025 through 2034 on a conventional basis. May 5, 2025: We estimate the tariffs imposed as of May 2025 would raise $2.1 trillion of revenue from 2025 through 2034, while reducing US economic output by 0.8 percent in the long run. April 10, 2025, the House adopted the Senate’s amended version of the budget resolution, which allows $5.3 trillion in deficit-financed tax cuts (the combination of $3.8 trillion of tax cuts assumed to be “costless” under a current policy baseline plus $1.5 trillion in additional deficits permitted), deficit increases of $521 billion on defense and immigration spending, a minimum of $4 billion in spending cuts, and an increase in the debt limit of up to $5 trillion. April 2, 2025 , the Senate introduced an updated budget resolution to provide new guidance to its committees on tax and spending policy changes. It adopts the instructions in the House resolution for the House committees while instructing the Senate Finance Committee to make tax policy changes that reduce revenue by up to $1.5 trillion over 10 years against a current policy baseline , which assumes an additional $3.8 trillion in tax cuts. While the $3.8 trillion would not officially score as a deficit increase against a current policy baseline , it effectively permits $5.3 trillion in deficit-financed tax cuts. The Senate resolution gives the Chair of the Senate Budget Committee the ability to revise the numbers using a current tax policy baseline and instructs the Senate Finance Committee to propose an increase in the debt limit by up to $5 trillion. February 25, 2025 , the House passed a budget resolution to start the reconciliation process, specifying reductions in taxes and spending over the next decade relative to a current law baseline . The House budget resolution allows a $4.5 trillion increase in the deficit from tax cuts over the next decade so long as spending is cut by $1.7 trillion. If spending is not cut by $1.7 trillion, the cap on tax cuts will be reduced dollar-for-dollar; if spending is cut by more than $1.7 trillion, the cap on tax cuts will be increased by the same. February 21, 2025 , the Senate approved its own budget resolution to start the reconciliation process, but it does not permit any tax cuts. Compare Tax Plans Ways and Means Tax Plan Senate Finance Plan Trump 2024 Campaign Plan Executive-Imposed Tariffs TCJA Permanence Details On May 12, the House Ways and Means Committee The Committee on Ways and Means, more commonly referred to as the House Ways and Means Committee, is one of 29 U.S. House of Representative committees and is the chief tax -writing committee in the U.S. The House Ways and Means Committee has jurisdiction over all bills relating to taxes and other revenue generation, as well as spending programs like Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance, among others. released pre-mark legislative text to extend the expiring 2017 tax cuts and provide additional changes to the US tax system ahead of a markup hearing on May 13. The legislative text introduced by the Ways and Means Committee cuts taxes by less than the budget resolution instructions, implying either that spending reductions have fallen short of the target or that lawmakers are leaving room for further negotiations over certain tax items. Analysis Our preliminary analysis finds the tax provisions included in the May 12 text would increase long-run GDP by 0.6 percent, increase hours worked by 794,000 jobs, increase American incomes as measured by GNP by less than 0.05 percent, decrease wages by 0.1 percent, and decrease the capital stock by 0.2 percent. We estimate the tax provisions would reduce federal revenues by $4.0 trillion between 2025 and 2034. On a dynamic basis, incorporating the projected increase in long-run GDP of 0.6 percent, the revenue loss falls by 18.8 percent to $3.3 trillion over the 10-year budget window. Overall, the bill would prevent tax increases on 62 percent of taxpayers that would occur if the TCJA expired as scheduled. However, by introducing narrowly targeted new provisions and sunsetting the most pro-growth provisions , like bonus depreciation Bonus depreciation allows firms to deduct a larger portion of certain “short-lived” investments in new or improved technology, equipment, or buildings in the first year. Allowing businesses to write off more investments partially alleviates a bias in the tax code and incentivizes companies to invest more, which, in the long run, raises worker productivity, boosts wages, and creates more jobs. and research and development (R&D) expensing, it leaves economic growth on the table and complicates the structure of the tax code. House Ways and Means Tax Plan: Topline Preliminary Estimates 10-Year Conventional Revenue (Billions) Long-Run GDP Long-Run GNP Long-Run Wages Hours Worked Converted to Full-Time Equivalent Jobs -$4,048.4 0.6% Less than +0.05% -0.1% 794,000 See Full Analysis Details to come Details On the campaign trail, and reiterated in his March 4 joint address to Congress, President Trump called for permanence for the 2017 tax law, restoring the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, reducing the corporate tax rate for domestic production, exempting various types of income from the income tax, repealing green energy tax credits, and imposing steep new tariffs. Analysis Some of Trump’s tax proposals are well-designed and would be efficient ways to promote long-run economic growth, such as permanent expensing for machinery, equipment, and research and development (R&D). Some of his tax proposals are poorly designed and would worsen the structure of the tax code while only creating a muted impact on long-run economic growth, such as the exemptions for tips and Social Security income. Worse yet, Trump’s reliance on import tariffs to offset the cost of tax cuts come with major downsides. Tariffs are a particularly distortive way to raise revenue, especially as they invite foreign retaliation. We estimate Trump’s proposed tariffs and partial retaliation from all trading partners would together offset more than two-thirds of the long-run economic benefit of his proposed tax cuts. During the campaign, we estimated Trump’s tax proposals would increase long-run GDP by 0.8 percent, the capital stock by 1.7 percent, wages by 0.8 percent, and employment by 597,000 full-time equivalent jobs. We also estimated the proposals would increase the 10-year budget deficit by $3 trillion conventionally and $2.5 trillion dynamically. Trump 2024 Campaign Tax Plan: Topline Preliminary Estimates 10-Year Conventional Revenue (Billions) Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Gross National Product (GNP) Wages Hours Worked Converted to Full-Time Equivalent Jobs -$3,013.2 +0.8% -0.1% +0.8% +597,000 Source: Tax Foundation General Equilibrium Model, October 2024. See Full Analysis Details President Trump has imposed new tariffs on nearly all US trading partners as well as on specific products, affecting more than 70 percent of US imports. While the tariffs are not formally or officially part of the reconciliation context, they will have economic and revenue effects to consider alongside the tax package Congress produces. Analysis The tariffs imposed and scheduled to take effect as of April 2025 would increase federal tax revenue by $2.1 trillion from 2025 through 2034 on a conventional basis and decrease after-tax incomes by 1.2 percent on average. Before accounting for foreign retaliation, Tax Foundation estimates the tariffs will reduce long-run US output by 0.7 percent. Trumps Tariffs: Topline Preliminary Estimates 10-Year Conventional Revenue (Billions) Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Wages Hours Worked Converted to Full-Time Equivalent Jobs $2,080.4 -0.7% 0.0% -685,000 See Full Analysis Details Beginning January 1, 2026, most provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) will expire. Additionally, several business provisions have already expired or are phasing out. Without Congressional action, expiration of the individual provisions would increase taxes for 62 percent of taxpayers, while extension will significantly reduce federal revenues over the coming decade. Analysis Over the 2025 through 2034 budget window, permanence for the expiring TCJA individual provisions will reduce federal tax revenue by $3.6 trillion ($3.2 trillion dynamically), the expiring estate tax provisions by $240 billion ($240 billion dynamically), and the expiring business provisions by $648 billion ($351 billion dynamically). Long-run GDP would be 1.1 percent higher, offsetting $710 billion, or 16 percent, of the revenue losses. The $4.5 trillion reduction in tax revenues would increase the budget deficit and push up interest costs by an estimated $941 billion ($806 billion dynamically). Long-run GNP would only rise by 0.4 percent, as some of the benefits of the tax cuts and larger economy go to foreigners in the form of higher interest payments on the debt. As a result of the tax cuts, after-tax incomes would rise by 2.9 percent (3.4 percent dynamically) in 2026 on average. The share of filers who itemize would drop from 33 percent to 13 percent, and 62 percent of filers would see a tax cut from extending the individual provisions.

See Full Analysis Share this resource : taxfoundation.org/2025 What Is Budget Reconciliation? In 2017, Republicans used a procedure called budget reconciliation to pass the TCJA . Democrats used it for the American Rescue Plan Act ( ARPA ) in 2021, and the Inflation Reduction Act ( IRA ) in 2022. Reconciliation is a fast-track option to enact tax, spending, and debt limit changes outlined in a budget resolution, notably bypassing a filibuster in the Senate that would otherwise require 60 votes to avoid. Budget reconciliation allows Republicans to rely on a party-line vote for legislation, but they still face slim majorities in both chambers. Lawmakers can specify targets or limits on reductions or increases in the deficit within the budget window. The “ Byrd rule ” limits what can be included in a reconciliation bill, disallowing policy changes that don’t affect spending or revenue, and disallowing changes that increase the deficit outside of the budget window. Reconciliation also specifically prohibits changes to Social Security . What is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act? The 2017 Trump Tax Cuts, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA ), reduced average tax burdens for taxpayers across the income spectrum and temporarily simplified the tax filing process through structural reforms. It also boosted capital investment by reforming the corporate tax system and significantly improved the international tax system. At the end of 2025, the individual portions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expire all at once. Without congressional action, 62 percent of filers could soon face a tax increase relative to current policy in 2026. At the same time, the price tag for extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts is in the trillions . tax Calculator Interactive map TCJA Archives The Path Forward: Principled, Pro-Growth, Fiscally Responsible Tax Reform Congress is staring down the expiration of the TCJA, and the Tax Foundation is prepared to provide insight and analysis on the policies at stake. Since its enactment in 2017, the Tax Foundation team has studied the TCJA’s underlying construction and resulting strengths and weaknesses . We have also analyzed fundamental reforms that would dramatically improve the US tax system to support economic growth as well as greater efficiency and simplicity. Whether lawmakers target fundamental tax reform or follow the outline of the TCJA, they will confront decisions on what to prioritize in this forthcoming round of tax reform. In that regard, staying within the overall TCJA construct, the Tax Foundation team has analyzed difficult, but revenue-neutral ways to build a pro-growth set of reform options that would not significantly worsen the deficit once changes to the economy are considered or substantially change the distribution of the tax burden across the income scale.

Analysis Some of Trump’s tax proposals are well-designed and would be efficient ways to promote long-run economic growth, such as permanent expensing for machinery, equipment, and research and development (R&D). Some of his tax proposals are poorly designed and would worsen the structure of the tax code while only creating a muted impact on long-run economic growth, such as the exemptions for tips and Social Security income. Worse yet, Trump’s reliance on import tariffs to offset the cost of tax cuts come with major downsides. Tariffs are a particularly distortive way to raise revenue, especially as they invite foreign retaliation. We estimate Trump’s proposed tariffs and partial retaliation from all trading partners would together offset more than two-thirds of the long-run economic benefit of his proposed tax cuts. During the campaign, we estimated Trump’s tax proposals would increase long-run GDP by 0.8 percent, the capital stock by 1.7 percent, wages by 0.8 percent, and employment by 597,000 full-time equivalent jobs. We also estimated the proposals would increase the 10-year budget deficit by $3 trillion conventionally and $2.5 trillion dynamically.

See Full Analysis Details President Trump has imposed new tariffs on nearly all US trading partners as well as on specific products, affecting more than 70 percent of US imports. While the tariffs are not formally or officially part of the reconciliation context, they will have economic and revenue effects to consider alongside the tax package Congress produces. Analysis The tariffs imposed and scheduled to take effect as of April 2025 would increase federal tax revenue by $2.1 trillion from 2025 through 2034 on a conventional basis and decrease after-tax incomes by 1.2 percent on average. Before accounting for foreign retaliation, Tax Foundation estimates the tariffs will reduce long-run US output by 0.7 percent.

Additionally, several business provisions have already expired or are phasing out. Without Congressional action, expiration of the individual provisions would increase taxes for 62 percent of taxpayers, while extension will significantly reduce federal revenues over the coming decade. Analysis Over the 2025 through 2034 budget window, permanence for the expiring TCJA individual provisions will reduce federal tax revenue by $3.6 trillion ($3.2 trillion dynamically), the expiring estate tax provisions by $240 billion ($240 billion dynamically), and the expiring business provisions by $648 billion ($351 billion dynamically). Long-run GDP would be 1.1 percent higher, offsetting $710 billion, or 16 percent, of the revenue losses. The $4.5 trillion reduction in tax revenues would increase the budget deficit and push up interest costs by an estimated $941 billion ($806 billion dynamically). Long-run GNP would only rise by 0.4 percent, as some of the benefits of the tax cuts and larger economy go to foreigners in the form of higher interest payments on the debt. As a result of the tax cuts, after-tax incomes would rise by 2.9 percent (3.4 percent dynamically) in 2026 on average. The share of filers who itemize would drop from 33 percent to 13 percent, and 62 percent of filers would see a tax cut from extending the individual provisions.

See Full Analysis Share this resource : taxfoundation.org/2025 What Is Budget Reconciliation? In 2017, Republicans used a procedure called budget reconciliation to pass the TCJA . Democrats used it for the American Rescue Plan Act ( ARPA ) in 2021, and the Inflation Reduction Act ( IRA ) in 2022. Reconciliation is a fast-track option to enact tax, spending, and debt limit changes outlined in a budget resolution, notably bypassing a filibuster in the Senate that would otherwise require 60 votes to avoid. Budget reconciliation allows Republicans to rely on a party-line vote for legislation, but they still face slim majorities in both chambers. Lawmakers can specify targets or limits on reductions or increases in the deficit within the budget window. The “ Byrd rule ” limits what can be included in a reconciliation bill, disallowing policy changes that don’t affect spending or revenue, and disallowing changes that increase the deficit outside of the budget window. Reconciliation also specifically prohibits changes to Social Security . What is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act? The 2017 Trump Tax Cuts, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA ), reduced average tax burdens for taxpayers across the income spectrum and temporarily simplified the tax filing process through structural reforms. It also boosted capital investment by reforming the corporate tax system and significantly improved the international tax system. At the end of 2025, the individual portions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expire all at once. Without congressional action, 62 percent of filers could soon face a tax increase relative to current policy in 2026. At the same time, the price tag for extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts is in the trillions . tax Calculator Interactive map TCJA Archives The Path Forward: Principled, Pro-Growth, Fiscally Responsible Tax Reform Congress is staring down the expiration of the TCJA, and the Tax Foundation is prepared to provide insight and analysis on the policies at stake. Since its enactment in 2017, the Tax Foundation team has studied the TCJA’s underlying construction and resulting strengths and weaknesses . We have also analyzed fundamental reforms that would dramatically improve the US tax system to support economic growth as well as greater efficiency and simplicity. Whether lawmakers target fundamental tax reform or follow the outline of the TCJA, they will confront decisions on what to prioritize in this forthcoming round of tax reform. In that regard, staying within the overall TCJA construct, the Tax Foundation team has analyzed difficult, but revenue-neutral ways to build a pro-growth set of reform options that would not significantly worsen the deficit once changes to the economy are considered or substantially change the distribution of the tax burden across the income scale.

However, the Bank cautioned that inflation remains persistently high, continuing to erode household incomes. In its latest Nigeria Development Update , published Monday in Abuja, the World Bank revealed that the country’s real GDP rose by 4.6 percent year-on-year in the final quarter of 2024, pushing overall annual growth to 3.4 percent. This marks the fastest pace of economic expansion since 2014, excluding the temporary rebound that followed the COVID-19 slump in 2021–2022. The uptick in growth was attributed primarily to a recovering oil and gas sector and robust performance in the technology and financial services industries. However, the agriculture sector lagged behind, posting a growth rate of just 1.2 percent in 2024. The Bank cited persistent insecurity in Nigeria’s Middle Belt — a key farming region — alongside high input costs, as key factors hampering agricultural output. Looking ahead, the World Bank projects a modest improvement in growth, forecasting a 3.7 percent expansion for 2025. Nevertheless, it warned that inflation, described as “high and sticky”, will continue to burden the economy. The average inflation rate is expected to fall slightly to 22.1 percent in 2025. Taimur Samad, the acting World Bank country director for Nigeria, commended recent reform efforts, saying: “Nigeria has made impressive strides to restore macroeconomic stability.” Since taking office in May 2023, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu has implemented sweeping economic reforms aimed at restructuring public finances in Africa’s most populous nation. Among these reforms are the removal of longstanding fuel subsidies and the liberalisation of the naira exchange rate, both of which have been endorsed by global financial institutions. Yet, these changes have sparked widespread hardship, fuelling a severe cost-of-living crisis that has left many Nigerians struggling to cope. The World Bank noted that nearly half of the country’s population was living in poverty in 2024, with soaring inflation and stagnant wages diminishing purchasing power, particularly in urban areas. “Labour incomes have not kept pace with inflation,” the report said. “Poverty has deepened and broadened, especially among urban Nigerians.” Echoing similar concerns, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said last month that while the government’s reforms are significant, their benefits have yet to be felt by the average citizen.
