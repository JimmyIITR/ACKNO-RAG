Revenue Procedure 2024-40 PDF provides detailed information on adjustments and changes to more than 60 tax provisions that will impact taxpayers when they file their returns in 2026. Notable changes for tax year 2025 The tax year 2025 adjustments described below generally apply to income tax returns to be filed starting tax season 2026. The tax items for tax year 2025 of greatest interest to many taxpayers include the following dollar amounts: Standard deductions. For single taxpayers and married individuals filing separately for tax year 2025, the standard deduction rises to $15,000 for 2025, an increase of $400 from 2024. For married couples filing jointly, the standard deduction rises to $30,000, an increase of $800 from tax year 2024. For heads of households, the standard deduction will be $22,500 for tax year 2025, an increase of $600 from the amount for tax year 2024. Marginal rates. For tax year 2025, the top tax rate remains 37% for individual single taxpayers with incomes greater than $626,350 ($751,600 for married couples filing jointly). The other rates are: 35% for incomes over $250,525 ($501,050 for married couples filing jointly). 32% for incomes over $197,300 ($394,600 for married couples filing jointly). 24% for incomes over $103,350 ($206,700 for married couples filing jointly). 22% for incomes over $48,475 ($96,950 for married couples filing jointly). 12% for incomes over $11,925 ($23,850 for married couples filing jointly). 10% for incomes $11,925 or less ($23,850 or less for married couples filing jointly). Alternative minimum tax exemption amounts. For tax year 2025, the exemption amount for unmarried individuals increases to $88,100 ($68,650 for married individuals filing separately) and begins to phase out at $626,350. For married couples filing jointly, the exemption amount increases to $137,000 and begins to phase out at $1,252,700. Earned income tax credits. For qualifying taxpayers who have three or more qualifying children, the tax year 2025 maximum Earned Income Tax Credit amount is $8,046, an increase from $7,830 for tax year 2024. The revenue procedure contains a table providing maximum EITC amount for other categories, income thresholds and phase-outs. Qualified transportation fringe benefit. For tax year 2025, the monthly limitation for the qualified transportation fringe benefit and the monthly limitation for qualified parking rises to $325, increasing from $315 in tax year 2024. Health flexible spending cafeteria plans. For the taxable years beginning in 2025, the dollar limitation for employee salary reductions for contributions to health flexible spending arrangements rises to $3,300, increasing from $3,200 in tax year 2024. For cafeteria plans that permit the carryover of unused amounts, the maximum carryover amount rises to $660, increasing from $640 in tax year 2024. Medical savings accounts . For tax year 2025, participants who have self-only coverage the plan must have an annual deductible that is not less than $2,850 (a $50 increase from the previous tax year), but not more than $4,300 (an increase of $150 from the previous tax year). The maximum out-of-pocket expense amount rises to $5,700, increasing from $5,550 in tax year 2024. For family coverage in tax year 2025, the annual deductible is not less than $5,700, increasing from $5,550 in tax year 2024; however, the deductible cannot be more than $8,550, an increase of $200 versus the limit for tax year 2024. For family coverage, the out-of-pocket expense limit is $10,500 for tax year 2025, rising from $10,200 in tax year 2024. Foreign earned income exclusion. For tax year 2025, the foreign earned income exclusion increases to $130,000, from $126,500 in tax year 2024. Estate tax credits. Estates of decedents who die during 2025 have a basic exclusion amount of $13,990,000, increased from $13,610,000 for estates of decedents who died in 2024. Annual exclusion for gifts increases to $19,000 for calendar year 2025, rising from $18,000 for calendar year 2024. Adoption credits. For tax year 2025, the maximum credit allowed for an adoption of a child with special needs is the amount of qualified adoption expenses up to $17,280, increased from $16,810 for tax year 2024. Unchanged for tax year 2025 By statute, certain items that were indexed for inflation in the past are currently not adjusted. Personal exemptions for tax year 2025 remain at 0, as in tax year 2024. The elimination of the personal exemption was a provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Itemized deductions. There is no limitation on itemized deductions for tax year 2025, as in tax year 2024 and preceding, to tax year 2018. The limitation on itemized deductions was eliminated by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Lifetime learning credits. The modified adjusted gross income amount used by taxpayers to determine the reduction in the Lifetime Learning Credit provided in Sec. 25A(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code is not adjusted for inflation for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2020. The Lifetime Learning Credit is phased out for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income in excess of $80,000 ($160,000 for joint returns).

Revenue Procedure 2023-34 provides detailed information about these annual adjustments. New for 2024 Starting in calendar year 2023, the Inflation Reduction Act reinstates the Hazardous Substance Superfund financing rate for crude oil received at U.S. refineries, and petroleum products that entered into the United States for consumption, use, or warehousing.

For calendar years beginning in 2024, the Hazardous Substance Superfund financing rate is adjusted for inflation. For calendar year 2024 crude oil or petroleum products entered after Dec. 31, 2016, will have a tax rate of $0.26 cents a barrel.

The Alternative Minimum Tax exemption amount for tax year 2024 is $85,700 and begins to phase out at $609,350 ($133,300 for married couples filing jointly for whom the exemption begins to phase out at $1,218,700). For comparison, the 2023 exemption amount was $81,300 and began to phase out at $578,150 ($126,500 for married couples filing jointly for whom the exemption began to phase out at $1,156,300). The tax year 2024 maximum Earned Income Tax Credit amount is $7,830 for qualifying taxpayers who have three or more qualifying children, an increase of from $7,430 for tax year 2023. The revenue procedure contains a table providing maximum EITC amount for other categories, income thresholds and phase-outs. For tax year 2024, the monthly limitation for the qualified transportation fringe benefit and the monthly limitation for qualified parking increases to $315, an increase of $15 from the limit for 2023. For the taxable years beginning in 2024, the dollar limitation for employee salary reductions for contributions to health flexible spending arrangements increases to $3,200. For cafeteria plans that permit the carryover of unused amounts, the maximum carryover amount is $640, an increase of $30 from taxable years beginning in 2023. For tax year 2024, participants who have self-only coverage in a Medical Savings Account, the plan must have an annual deductible that is not less than $2,800, an increase of $150 from tax year 2023, but not more than $4,150, an increase of $200 from tax year 2023. For self-only coverage, the maximum out-of-pocket expense amount is $5,550, an increase of $250 from 2023. For tax year 2024, for family coverage, the annual deductible is not less than $5,550, an increase of $200 from tax year 2023; however, the deductible cannot be more than $8,350, an increase of $450 versus the limit for tax year 2023.

Items unaffected by indexing By statute, certain items that were indexed for inflation in the past are currently not adjusted.

For 2024, as in 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018, there is no limitation on itemized deductions, as that limitation was eliminated by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The modified adjusted gross income amount used by taxpayers to determine the reduction in the Lifetime Learning Credit provided in § 25A(d)(2) is not adjusted for inflation for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2020.

February 20, 2025 Key provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 are set to expire Dec. 31, 2025. With a Republican-led White House and Congress, policymakers are projected to preserve a majority of the TCJA provisions, but they will need to find a source of funding for the extensions. The debate over tax policy, the federal budget, and the federal deficit is ongoing. Government affairs professionals with interests on either side of the debate need to track tax policy developments as they happen. Staying ahead of policy developments is one of the most critical tasks when planning a successful lobbying and public affairs strategy , especially when it comes to a policy area poised for change, like tax. [Download our report, Tracking and Influencing Tax Policy in 2025 , for tips and best practices to better monitor, respond to, and influence critical tax policy changes with confidence and precision.] What is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act? The TCJA, passed by a majority-Republican Congress in 2017, was the largest tax code overhaul in nearly three decades. The law cut the corporate tax rate to 21%, capped deductions for state and local taxes (SALT) at $10,000, doubled standard deductions, and expanded the child tax credit. The goal of the one and a half trillion-dollar tax reform bill was to spur economic growth, reduce regulations, and create a more business-friendly environment in the U.S. The TCJA was passed as reconciliation legislation, meaning the bill overrode typical filibuster rules and was passed by a Republican-led Senate with a simple majority of 51 votes. However, many provisions were made temporary to keep costs down and comply with the Byrd Rule, which prohibits reconciliation bills from raising the federal deficit beyond a 10-year budget window or making changes to Social Security. Does the 21% corporate tax rate expire? The TCJA cut the corporate tax rate to 21%, from 35%, which does not expire. Even though the corporate rate was made permanent, lawmakers are reopening the tax code to address all of the TCJA’s expiring provisions, so everything is on the table. While on the campaign trail, Trump has stated that he intends to reduce the corporate rate to 15% for companies that make their products in America. Republicans may have to swallow raising the rate back up a bit during the 2025 negotiations, as Congress will need to find ways to offset a loss of revenue from extending other pieces of the TCJA, especially those benefits for individual taxpayers. Which TCJA corporate tax provisions are set to expire? The potential expiration of the TCJA’s corporate tax provisions poses significant implications for U.S. businesses, including changes to the corporate tax rate, capital expensing, the pass-through income deduction, and international taxation. The following sections describe which provisions are set to expire in more depth. Pass-through income deduction Pass-through businesses – sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S-corporations – will no longer be able to deduct up to 20% of qualified business income (QBI) when calculating annual taxes. Republicans are more staunch supporters of the 199A deduction and claim that it levels the playing field for small and mid-sized business by reducing their tax burden in a similar way to how the TCJA’s corporate tax rate cut did for C-corporations. Industries that primarily benefit from the deduction, such as real estate and manufacturing, have revved up lobbying efforts on Capitol Hill to extend the tax break. Many groups are targeting moderate Democrats to create bipartisan support for the deduction’s extension. Business expense deductions Bonus depreciation The 100% bonus depreciation provision – allowing the deduction of certain capital investments – will be phased out by 2027. The 2025 bonus depreciation rate will be reduced to 40%. Research and development (R&D) The TCJA’s amortization requirement will remain in effect beyond 2025 unless Congress acts to repeal or modify it. The Wyden-Smith bill aims to restore immediate expensing for R&D costs and expand the R&D tax credit. Business interest deduction The business interest deduction will revert to pre-TCJA rules, which generally allowed business interest expenses to be deducted in the year the interest was paid or accrued, with some limitations. International tax provisions International tax policy has significantly changed since TCJA’s passage. Brokered by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a global agreement called Pillar 2, went into effect in 2024 in many countries and will continue to impact businesses worldwide. Pillar 2 aims to curb base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) by applying a 15% minimum tax rate for multinational enterprises (MNEs) with a global annual revenue of 750 million euros. The TCJA also attempts to address tax avoidance through measures such as the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) tax, the foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) tax, and the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT). However, the TCJA’s provisions and Pillar 2 clash on several key details. There is a safe harbor provision that shields U.S. companies from some of the harshest effects of Pillar 2. But given that the safe harbor provisions expires at the end of 2026, Congress will need to decide how to rectify the TCJA and Pillar 2 clash. [Are you a tax professional? See how Bloomberg Tax provides the tools and intelligence to guide your tax department through changes with ease.] Which TCJA individual tax provisions are set to expire? If Congress doesn’t renew or amend TCJA tax provisions, then individual filers will see a rise in their income tax rates, a lower standard deduction, changes to itemized deductions, and a rollback of the child tax credit. These changes could reshape the financial outlook for many Americans. See more details below. Individual tax rates When the TCJA expires at the end of 2025, marginal tax rates for individuals will revert to pre-TCJA levels, including a maximum rate of 39.6% from 37%. Generally, Democrats are hoping to raise the top rate back up, whereas Republicans support lowering marginal rates. Standard deductions The TCJA nearly doubled the standard deduction for both single and joint filers when it went into effect in 2018. Once the TCJA expires in 2025, the standard deduction will return to pre-TCJA levels, with an adjustment for inflation. Standard deductions before and after TCJA Mortgage interest and charitable donation deductions Once the TCJA expires, single and joint filers will be able to claim a mortgage interest deduction (MID) on properties up to $1 million in value. Between 2018 and 2025, the TCJA limited the MID to $750,000 in property value. Charitable contributions will revert to 50% from 60% of adjusted gross income (AGI). In general, itemized deductions will be more relevant with lower standard deductions. If the standard deduction goes back to a lower level, those making at least $400,000 would see diminishing value of the MID and charity deductions. SALT deductions The $10,000 SALT deduction cap will no longer apply. Since 2018, lawmakers from high-tax states, such as California, New Jersey, and New York, have tried and failed to get rid of or raise the cap, reporting that their constituents were disproportionately affected. Prior to the TCJA, there was no cap on SALT deductions. However, there were levers in place – such as the alternative minimum tax (AMT) – to ensure wealthy taxpayers couldn’t use deductions and loopholes to reduce their federal tax liability to zero. Estate and gift taxes Exemptions from estate and gift taxes will revert to pre-TCJA levels of around $5 million, adjusted for inflation. The 2024 exemption is $13.6 million. Republicans see the estate tax as a “death tax” that punishes wealth accumulation, as in the case of farmers who want to pass on their land through inheritance, but their estate ends up needing to sell assets to cover the estate taxes. Democrats, on the other hand, view the estate and gift taxes as a means to address inequities, where high income earners cannot pass on substantial fortunes or trusts without paying their fair share in taxes. Child tax credit The maximum child tax credit (CTC) will return to $1,000 per child, from the TCJA level of $2,000. Income thresholds will decrease to $75,000 for individuals and $110,000 for married couples. During the pandemic, the CTC was raised even further to $3,600. Census data showed that it cut childhood poverty in half, as a lot more families were eligible for the program. Although Democrats did not vote for the TCJA, party members back the expansion of the CTC. The bipartisan Wyden-Smith bill – which aims to raise the cap on CTC back to $2,000 – has languished in the Senate, though, due to opposition from Senate Republicans. On-demand webinar: Preparing for tax changes post-2025 Chris Cioffi and Danielle Parnass of Bloomberg Government and Kim Dixon of Bloomberg Tax discuss individual and corporate tax provisions that are on the table following TCJA’s expiration and how key decision-makers aim to extend or amend those areas of tax law. See the full replay on tax policy . [Are you a tax professional? See how Bloomberg Tax provides the tools and intelligence to guide your tax department through changes with ease.] Will the TCJA be extended? Partisan control of Congress will have a big impact on whether TCJA provisions will be renewed, reformed, or allowed to expire. Republicans are looking to extend the TCJA and further expand some tax cuts, while Democrats are focused on reforming tax breaks for lower- and middle-income households and raising taxes on wealthier individuals and corporations. There are several possible scenarios for tax policy proposals in 2025: Long-term extension If they control Congress following the 2024 election, Republican lawmakers are aiming to once again use the reconciliation process to extend the TCJA. Because reconciliation bills bypass the filibuster in the Senate and therefore don’t require 60 votes, it would be easier for GOP legislators to pass an extension of the TCJA – so long as there are no intra-party divisions that would affect the simple majority requirement. If Congress is divided, lawmakers could pass a bipartisan agreement that addresses expiring provisions in a long-term or permanent way. This happened in 2012 when a series of tax cuts enacted by George W. Bush were extended. Short-term extension Absent a full agreement, lawmakers could decide to extend the TCJA tax breaks by one or two years to give themselves more time for negotiations. This happened in 2010 when the government was divided after Democrats got “shellacked” in the midterms. Expiration If Congress fails to act, the TCJA’s provisions will expire and revert to pre-2017 levels. Although it is unlikely that all the provisions would expire, if this did happen, both corporate and individual taxpayers would experience a lot of uncertainty.

During the 2020 election campaign, he and his father were frequently accused by Donald Trump and his associates of wrongdoing in regards to China and Ukraine, allegations which they both denied. The New York Post reported on an alleged email in which an adviser from a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, apparently thanked Hunter for inviting him to meet his father, Joe Biden. Asked about the allegations, Joe Biden told a reporter it was a "smear campaign". No criminal activity has been proven, and no evidence has emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. In an interview with the BBC months after his father was sworn in as president, Hunter Biden defended his qualifications for the position at Burisma but added that, in retrospect, he had "missed... the perception that I would create". Claims of influence-peddling are common in Washington DC and Mr Trump's children have also been accused of conflicts of interest in lucrative business deals overseas. They, too, deny wrongdoing. What do we know about the federal investigation? The Justice Department is investigating Hunter Biden's finances including scrutinising some of his past Chinese business dealings and other transactions, a "person familiar with the matter" told The Associated Press in December . The tax investigation was launched in 2018 but Hunter Biden said he had learned about it for the first time in December 2020. Asked about the investigation by US broadcaster CBS this April, the president's son said: "I'm co-operating, completely. And I'm absolutely certain, 100% certain, that at the end of the investigation, that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing." What have the Bidens been accused of in China? The New York Post cited a purported email from Hunter Biden in August 2017 indicating he was receiving a $10m annual fee from a Chinese billionaire for "introductions alone", though it is unclear who was involved in the alleged introductions. Another purported email, which Fox News said it had confirmed, reportedly refers to a deal pursued by Hunter involving China's largest private energy firm. It is said to include a cryptic mention of "10 held by H for the big guy". Fox News cited unnamed sources as saying "the big guy" in the purported email was a reference to Joe Biden. This message is said to be from May 2017. Both emails would date from when the former US vice-president was a private citizen. A former business associate of Hunter Biden has come forward to say he can confirm the allegations. Tony Bobulinski told Fox News that, contrary to Joe Biden's statements that he had nothing to do with his son's business affairs, Hunter had "frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals" in China. Mr Bobulinski, who is reportedly a US Navy veteran, separately told Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he had met on two occasions with Joe Biden to discuss business deals with China, the first time in May 2017 when Barack Obama's former vice-president was a private citizen. He says he asked Joe Biden's brother, James, whether the family was concerned about possible scrutiny of the former vice-president's involvement in a potential business deal with a Chinese entity. Mr Bobulinski told Fox News that James Biden had replied: "Plausible deniability." Mr Bobulinski was invited by Mr Trump to be his guest at the final presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee on 22 October. What is known about Hunter's dealings in China? In 2013, Hunter flew aboard Air Force Two with his father, who was then vice-president, on an official visit to Beijing, where the younger Biden met investment banker Jonathan Li. Hunter told the New Yorker he had just met Mr Li for "a cup of coffee", but 12 days after the trip a private equity fund, BHR Partners, was approved by the Chinese authorities. Mr Li was chief executive and Hunter was a board member. He would hold a 10% stake. Getty Images Joe Biden walks out of Air Force Two with his granddaughter and son, Hunter Biden BHR is backed by some of China's largest state banks and by local governments, according to US media. Hunter Biden's lawyer said he had joined the board in an unpaid position "based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets". His lawyer also said his client did not acquire his financial stake in BHR until 2017, after his father had left office in the US. Hunter resigned from the board of BHR in April 2020, but still held his 10% stake in BHR as of July this year, according to the company report. What did the New York Post say about Hunter Biden and Ukraine? The New York Post reported an email from April 2015, in which an adviser to Burisma, Vadym Pozharskyi, apparently thanked Hunter Biden for inviting him to meet his father in Washington. Hunter was a director on the board of Burisma - a Ukrainian-owned private energy company while his father was the Obama administration's pointman on US-Ukrainian relations. Hunter was one of several foreigners on its board. The New York Post article did not provide evidence that the meeting had ever taken place. The Biden election campaign said there was no record of any such meeting on the former vice-president's "official schedule" from the time. But in a statement to Politico , the campaign also acknowledged that Mr Biden could have had an "informal interaction" with the Burisma adviser that did not appear on his official schedule, though it said any such encounter would have been "cursory". "Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague, have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official US policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing," said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr Biden. What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Biden's team has also decried the New York Post story as "Russian disinformation", though it did not say the emails were bogus. The New York Post article was shared by President Trump and his allies. Two of his former advisers, Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani, were involved in providing the story and the hard drive containing the alleged emails, to the newspaper. Mr Giuliani says the messages were found on a laptop that Hunter dropped off at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. Sceptics have noted that Mr Giuliani travelled in December 2019 to Kyiv where he met Ukrainian lawmaker Andriy Derkach, whom the US Treasury has designated as a longtime Kremlin agent. Mr Giuliani has acknowledged trying dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine. But the US Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, told Fox Business that the purported emails were not connected to a Russian disinformation effort. Other US media say they have been unable to verify the authenticity of the emails. Hunter has neither confirmed nor denied that he dropped off a laptop at the location. Hunter joined Burisma in 2014, and remained on the board until April 2019, when he decided to leave. Speaking to the BBC, he said Burisma had seen his name "as gold" and that it had played a large part in his appointment to the board. Twitter and Facebook's action over Joe Biden article reignites bias claims What are the Bidens accused of in Ukraine? Donald Trump and his allies accused Joe Biden of wrongdoing because he had pushed, while vice-president, for the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, who was investigating the company for which Hunter worked. In 2016, Joe Biden called for the dismissal of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin, whose office had Burisma and other companies under investigation. However, other Western leaders and major bodies that give financial support to Ukraine also wanted the prosecutor dismissed because they believed he was not active enough in tackling corruption. What else has the Biden campaign said? Shortly before the final presidential debate last year, the Democrat's camp released a statement denying wrongdoing. "Joe Biden has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever," said the statement. "He has never held stock in any such business arrangements nor has any family member or any other person ever held stock for him. "What is true is that Tony Bobulinski admitted on the record to Breitbart that he is angry that he was *not* able to go into business with Hunter and James Biden [Joe Biden's brother]." What did this have to do with impeachment? In 2019, details emerged of a phone call Mr Trump, the then president, had made to the president of Ukraine, in which he had urged the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens. President Trump's impeachment explained This led to charges by the Democrats that Mr Trump was trying to illegally pressure Ukraine to help damage his election rival, resulting in impeachment by the House of Representatives. Mr Trump denied he had done anything wrong, and he was later acquitted by the Republican-controlled US Senate. Getty Images President Trump holds a copy of The Washington Post the day after the US Senate acquitted him on two articles of impeachment Has anything been proven against the Bidens? While no criminal activity has been proven, it has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. A senior State Department official raised such concerns as far back as 2015. Joe Biden's son defends foreign dealings US Republican lawmakers launched an investigation and found last year that Hunter's work for the Ukrainian firm had been "problematic" - but there wasn't evidence that US foreign policy was influenced by it. No criminal charges were proven against Burisma either. The company issued a statement in 2017 saying "all legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations" against it were closed. Last year, Yuriy Lutsenko, the prosecutor in Ukraine who succeeded Viktor Shokin, told the BBC that there was no reason to investigate the Bidens under Ukrainian law. There is nothing illegal about sitting on a board of a company whilst family members serve in government. Hunter Biden's lawyers said in statement in October 2019 that he had undertaken "these business activities independently. He did not believe it appropriate to discuss them with his father, nor did he." Hunter told the New Yorker magazine that on the only occasion he had mentioned Burisma: "Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing.'" Amid all the scrutiny, Joe Biden promised last year that if he was elected president, no-one in his family would hold a job or have a business relationship with a foreign corporation or foreign government.

For the controversy surrounding Hunter Biden's laptop, see Hunter Biden laptop controversy . For allegations of corruption by the Bidens, see United States House Oversight Committee investigation into the Biden family . Viktor Shokin Joe Biden Hunter Biden Some of the primary subjects of the conspiracy theory The Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory is a series of false allegations that Joe Biden , while he was vice president of the United States , improperly withheld a loan guarantee and took a bribe to pressure Ukraine into firing prosecutor general Viktor Shokin to prevent a corruption investigation of Ukrainian gas company Burisma and to protect his son Hunter Biden , who was on the Burisma board . [ 1 ] As part of efforts by Donald Trump [ 2 ] and his campaign in the Trump–Ukraine scandal , which led to Trump's first impeachment , these falsehoods were spread in an attempt to damage Joe Biden's reputation and chances during the 2020 presidential campaign , and later in an effort to impeach him. [ 3 ] Joe Biden followed State Department intentions when he withheld the loan guarantee to pressure Ukraine into removing the prosecutor, [ 4 ] [ 5 ] who was seen as corrupt and failing to clean up Ukrainian corruption, [ 6 ] in accordance with the official and bipartisan policy of the United States , the European Union , the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] A confidential informant told the FBI that Burisma's owner said he was coerced to pay bribes to both Bidens to ensure Shokin was fired, though the informant was indicted in 2024 on charges he had fabricated the account. United States intelligence community analysis released in March 2021 found that proxies of Russian intelligence promoted and laundered misleading or unsubstantiated narratives about the Bidens "to US media organizations, US officials, and prominent US individuals, including some close to former President Trump and his administration." [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] The New York Times reported in May 2021 that a federal criminal investigation was examining a possible role by current and former Ukrainian officials, including whether they used former Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani , who was the subject of a separate but related federal investigation, to spread unsubstantiated claims. [ 13 ] A joint investigation by two Republican Senate committees released in September 2020 found no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden. A sweeping Republican House committee investigation of the Biden family has found no wrongdoing by December 2023. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] House Speaker Kevin McCarthy directed three committees to open a formal impeachment inquiry in September 2023, and on December 2 his successor Mike Johnson said he believed Republicans had enough votes in the House to initiate impeachment proceedings . The three committees released a report in August 2024 asserting Biden had "engaged in impeachable conduct," but they did not recommend proceeding to impeachment. [ 18 ] Background See also: Conspiracy theories related to the Trump–Ukraine scandal Since the Independence of Ukraine following the collapse of the Soviet Union , Russia has had a history of running direct and active measures to undermine the sovereignty of Ukraine. [ 19 ] This included placing operatives in the government, influencing elections, and encouraging corruption. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] After the start of the Russo-Ukrainian War , when Russia invaded Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, Russia began to take active measures to influence presidential elections in the United States . [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Beginning in 2014, this included efforts to discredit Joe Biden . [ 25 ] The series of false allegations about Joe Biden and Burisma [ 25 ] emerged at a convergence of interest between Russian efforts to help Trump's candidacy, [ 26 ] operatives and supporters of the Trump campaign, [ 27 ] and media in the United States. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] The thesis of the false conspiracy theory asserts that Joe Biden sought the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor to protect his son, [ 26 ] and that he did it in a quid pro quo manner by trading loan guarantees for the personal favor. This is in contrast to the attempted quid pro quo by President Trump, who unsuccessfully tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a quid pro quo manner to start a publicly announced investigation of Burisma and the Bidens in exchange for military aid and a visit to the White House. Trump's effort resulted in his first impeachment. [ 25 ] In January 2018, a videotaping by the Council on Foreign Relations shows Biden taking credit for withholding the loan guarantees to have the prosecutor fired. [ 30 ] His actions were implementations of bipartisan US policy rather than done for any of the reasons alleged in the conspiracy theory. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Bribery allegation In June 2020, a confidential informant, later convicted for false statements to the FBI, [ 33 ] Alexander Smirnov , lied to the FBI that Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevsky had said he had been coerced into paying Hunter Biden a $5 million bribe, as well as a $5 million bribe to "another Biden," to ensure Shokin would be fired. The FBI memorialized Smirnov's lies in an FD-1023 form , which read in part: Zlochevsky said he had a total of "17 recordings" involving the Bidens; two of the recordings included Joe Biden, and the remaining 15 recordings only included Hunter Biden. [The informant] reiterated that, per Zlochevsky, these recordings evidence Zlochevsky was somehow coerced into paying the Bidens to ensure Ukraine Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin was fired. [ 4 ] [ 34 ] Smirnov also told the FBI that Zlochevsky said Burisma had hired Hunter Biden to "protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems." [ 35 ] The FD-1023 came to the attention of the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee investigation of the Biden family in 2023, leading to allegations of bribery that contributed to the Republican-controlled House voting to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Biden in December 2023. Republican committee member Nancy Mace asserted in a September 2023 public hearing, "We already know the president took bribes from Burisma." [ 36 ] In February 2024, Smirnov was arrested by the FBI upon arriving in Las Vegas on a flight from an overseas location. He was indicted on charges that he had fabricated his account of conversations with Zlochevsky. The indictment asserted Smirnov appeared to have a political bias against Joe Biden, telling FBI handlers during the 2020 presidential campaign that he had evidence that would put Biden in jail. [ 35 ] [ 37 ] Days after the indictment, prosecutors said Smirnov had admitted Russian intelligence officials had passed a false story about Hunter Biden to him and Smirnov had been "actively peddling new lies that could impact US elections" since meeting with Russian agents in late 2023. Prosecutors also said Smirnov is a dual U.S. and Israeli citizen who should be detained pending trial; the presiding magistrate judge ordered him released provided he surrender his passports and wear a GPS monitor. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] In December 2024, Smirnov pleaded guilty to one count of lying to the FBI and was sentenced to six years in prison the following month. [ 40 ] [ 41 ] Conspirators The falsehoods about Hunter Biden were spread by possible Russian operatives in the Ukrainian parliament, [ 42 ] right-wing media supportive of Trump, [ 25 ] and members of the Trump campaign, such as Rudy Giuliani and Steve Bannon . [ 43 ] Russian involvement Russian involvement was coordinated by Russian GRU lieutenant general Vladimir Alekseyevin , his deputy Oleksiy Savin, and Ihor Kolesnikov. [ 44 ] They coordinated a network spreading the false allegations through Ukrainian lawmakers Oleksandr Dubinsky and Andrii Derkach , Prosecutor Kostiantyn Kulyk and businessmen Dmytro Firtash and Konstantin Kilimnik . [ 25 ] The three were given ten million dollars [ 45 ] and used corrupt access to the Ukrainian Parliament and connections to media and politicians in the United States to spread the falsehoods. [ 46 ] Dubinsky, Derkach and Kulyk were sanctioned by the U.S. government in the closing days of the Trump administration, and in November 2023 Ukrainian authorities indicted them on treason charges. [ 47 ] Ihor Kolesnikov Ihor Kolesnikov, a Soviet-era GRU officer, coordinated the election subversion network from Kyiv. [ 48 ] Kolesnikov would organize Press Conferences for Oleksander Dubinsky and Andri Derkach. He was sentenced to fifteen years for treason in May 2022. [ 48 ] Oleksander Dubinsky Oleksandr Dubinsky is a member of the Ukrainian Parliament who four years ago helped Rudy Giuliani in his attempts to find information in support of the false Biden-Ukraine conspiracy. Dubinsky is accused of treason for allegedly working to help Russia in its war against Ukraine. [ 45 ] Dubinsky held Press Conference with Andrii Derkach to spread the false rumors. [ 47 ] He also met with Rudy Giuliani in 2019 for the production of a falsified film about the conspiracy. [ 49 ] In May 2021 Dubinsky was sanctioned by the US Government, his assets frozen, and his YouTube channel shutdown. In November 2023 Oleksander Dubinsky was charged for carrying out subversive informational activities by publishing "fakes about the alleged interference of Ukrainian high-ranking officials" in the U.S. 2020 presidential elections. [ 48 ] Andrii Derkach Andrii Derkach is a former Ukrainian politician, now stripped of citizenship, [ 50 ] who is believed to have been an agent or asset of Russia. [ 51 ] He played a central role in spreading falsehoods about Biden and Ukraine. [ 25 ] Derkach released snippets of a supposed conversation between Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Poroshenko, in which Biden linked loan guarantees to the ouster of Viktor Shokin, the country's corrupt and ineffective prosecutor general. [ 5 ] The recordings, which were not verified as authentic and appeared to be heavily edited, [ 52 ] did not provide evidence to support the ongoing conspiracy theory that Biden wanted the prosecutor fired to protect his son. [ 53 ] In June 2020, Poroshenko denied that Joe Biden ever approached him about Burisma and characterized the recordings as fake. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] In September 2020, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Derkach, stating he "has been an active Russian agent for over a decade, maintaining close connections with the Russian Intelligence Services". The Treasury Department added that Derkach "waged a covert influence campaign centered on cultivating false and unsubstantiated narratives concerning U.S. officials in the upcoming 2020 Presidential Election," including by the release of "edited audio tapes and other unsupported information with the intent to discredit U.S. officials". [ 56 ] [ 57 ] Kostiantyn Kulyk In 2019, as deputy prosecutor general. Mr Kulyk wrote a 2019 memo calling for an investigation into Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board. [ 47 ] Later that year he had plans to meet Mr Giuliani to discuss the allegations in order to spread the false conspiracy. [ 58 ] Kulyk has been indicted on multiple corruption charges. [ 59 ] Kulyk, though, fled Ukraine after Russia's invasion in 2022 [ 47 ] and is also sanctioned by the United States for his role in the subversive activities. [ 60 ] Dmytro Firtash Dmytro Firtash was a middleman for Gazprom and connected to the Ukrainian government. [ 61 ] He has acknowledged that he was installed as a middleman by Russian mob boss Semion Mogilevich . [ 62 ] Since 2014 Firtash has faced bribery charges and fought extradition to the United States while he has been released on bail in Austria. He wired one million dollars to the wife of Lev Parnas , a former associate of Giuliani. He provided a now-discredited affidavit from Kulyk accusing Biden of wrongdoing. Trump and Giuliani associates Joe DiGenova and Victoria Toensing attempted to persuade Attorney General William Barr to drop charges against Firtash but failed. [ 62 ] Konstantin Kilimnik Konstantin Kilimnik oversaw a network of people working on behalf of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) to influence the 2020 elections. [ 63 ] Kilimnik had the single strongest ties, authorized by President Putin , [ 64 ] to the Trump administration in both 2016 and 2020 elections. [ 65 ] He organized Russia's media outreach campaigns to spread lies about Biden and corruption in Ukraine as part of Russia's efforts to help Trump. [ 66 ] [ 67 ] American media involvement American media organizations with ties to the Trump campaign were involved in the spread of the false allegations. [ 25 ] Specifically Peter Schweizer , [ 68 ] John Solomon , [ 25 ] Fox News , [ 69 ] and One America News Network [ 70 ] were essential in creating and disseminating the lies that built the background for this conspiracy theory. Peter Schweizer Peter Schweizer , editor-at-large at Breitbart News and president of the conservative Government Accountability Institute , was the first person to spread the falsehoods about Joe Biden and Burisma in his book "Secret Empires". [ 25 ] The plagiarized book [ 71 ] included a false story that on January 12, 2017, Joe Biden, who was then the vice-president, sought to end an investigation into Burisma to protect Hunter Biden, who had a profitable post on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company run by a shady oligarch. [ 25 ] Schweizer launched a media blitz in 2019 to help the conspiracy spread and appeared and wrote editorials repeating his lie in multiple news outlets. [ 72 ] This, in turn, helped to lead Trump allies in Ukraine [ 73 ] and Congress to promote the lie. [ 74 ] John Solomon Washington Post attributes John Solomon , formerly of The Hill , the most responsibility [ 75 ] for the spread of the untrue claims in U.S. media. [ 25 ] Beginning in the spring of 2019, Solomon published a series of editorials which The Hill notes are now part of Congressional inquiries due to their connection to the spreading of lies. Solomon relied heavily on Schweizer's book. [ 25 ] The story being pushed by Solomon had significant flaws, [ 75 ] including relying on a corrupt source who would not substantiate the claims. [ 76 ] In testimony before Congress, Alexander Vindman said Solomon's claims were "entirely made up in full cloth". [ 77 ] Media Matters reported in September 2023 that the previous month Solomon published a State Department briefing memo prepared for Joe Biden's December 2015 trip to Ukraine. The memo read, in part: There is wide agreement that anti-corruption must be at the top of this list, and that reforms must include an overhaul of the Prosecutor General's Office including removal of Prosecutor General Shokin, who is widely regarded as an obstacle to fighting corruption, if not a source of the problem. [ 78 ] Fox News Fox News was also involved in the spread of the falsehoods. [ 69 ] Fox ran at least twelve broadcasts about John Solomon's report about the Burisma probe. The false conspiracy theory was mentioned on Sean Hannity 's program, with him claiming Solomon had caught Joe Biden in an "international corruption scandal". [ 79 ] [ 80 ] One America News Network One America News Network (OANN) is a far-right , pro-Trump news outlet with reporters who also work for Russian news agencies, [ 70 ] and the network was essential to spreading lies about Biden and Burisma. [ 81 ] OANN produced a "documentary series intended to debunk the impeachment case", and an OANN crew traveled with Rudy Giuliani to Ukraine to gather information. [ 58 ] OANN later aired a misleading documentary about Biden and Burisma called " The Ukraine Hoax: Impeachment, Biden Cash, and Mass Murder " [ 82 ] produced by Michael Caputo , [ 81 ] a member of the Trump campaign, and Sergey Petrushin , a Russian living in Florida. The documentary used fake documents provided to Giuliani by Parnas on behalf of Andrii Derkach and Konstantin Kilimnik . [ 69 ] Following Caputo's work in spreading the falsehoods through OANN, Donald Trump made Caputo the assistant secretary of public affairs for the Department of Health and Human Services . Trump campaign involvement The Trump campaign's actions in spreading the conspiracy, especially the active engagement of Rudy Giuliani with possible Russian agents, [ 83 ] were highlighted during Donald Trump's first impeachment . [ 84 ] Trump's first impeachment Trump's first impeachment charge of abuse of power was triggered by a July 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , in which then-President Trump unsuccessfully tried to pressure Zelenskyy in a quid pro quo manner to start a publicly announced investigation of Burisma and the Bidens in exchange for the release of congressionally mandated financial and military aid to Ukraine and the promise of a Trump–Zelenskyy meeting at the White House. [ 85 ] During the hearings and impeachment trial of President Trump in 2019–20, he and his allies repeatedly alleged that Joe Biden and his son had engaged in corrupt activities in Ukraine. [ 84 ] [ 86 ] Trump said he planned to make it a major issue during the 2020 United States presidential election , [ 87 ] while a Republican-controlled Senate committee carried out an investigation into the allegations in spring 2020. [ 88 ] The investigation by the Republican-controlled Senate Homeland Security and Finance Committees concluded in September 2020 that Hunter Biden " ' cashed in' on his father's name to close lucrative business deals around the world", but that there was no evidence of improper influence or wrongdoing by Joe Biden. [ 89 ] Rudy Giuliani Working together with Andrii Derkach (an active Russian agent), [ 56 ] Dmytro Firtash , and other individuals linked to Russian intelligence and organized crime, [ 90 ] [ 54 ] Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani , and his associates spearheaded an effort to gather information in Ukraine to advance the allegations, and Attorney General William Barr confirmed that the Justice Department had created an "intake process" to review Giuliani's findings. [ 91 ] In late 2019, it was revealed that the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York , which Giuliani had once led, was investigating him for multiple felonies relating to his activities in Ukraine. [ 92 ] [ 93 ] Intelligence officials warned Ron Johnson , the chairman of the Senate committee investigating the Bidens, that he risked spreading Russian disinformation. [ 94 ] The Washington Post reported in October 2020 that American intelligence agencies warned the White House in 2019 that Giuliani was the target of a Russian influence operation, and National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien warned President Trump about accepting what Giuliani told him. While monitoring Russian assets, U.S. intelligence recorded Giuliani communicating with them. [ 95 ] According to officials interviewed by The Daily Beast , then-National Security Advisor John Bolton told his staff not to meet with Giuliani, as did his successor Robert C. O'Brien, because Bolton had been informed that Giuliani was spreading conspiracy theories that aligned with Russian interests in disrupting the 2020 election. These officials were also concerned that Giuliani would be used as a conduit for disinformation, including "leaks" of emails that would mix genuine with forged material to implicate Hunter Biden in corrupt dealings. [ 96 ] Interviewed by The Daily Beast, Giuliani would later declare that Derkach's being sanctioned was the result of a conspiracy led by George Soros and that "the chance that Derkach is a Russian spy is no better than 50/50". [ 97 ] In October 2020, during the last weeks of the presidential campaign, the New York Post published an article, with the involvement of Donald Trump's personal attorney Giuliani and former chief strategist Steve Bannon , about a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden . The laptop contained an email, the authenticity of which was later verified by The Washington Post in 2022, [ 98 ] showing what the New York Post characterized as a "meeting" between Joe Biden and Vadym Pozharskyi, a Burisma advisor, in 2015, though that characterization was disputed by witnesses. [ 5 ] The article's veracity was strongly questioned by most mainstream media outlets, analysts and intelligence officials, due to the chain of custody of the laptop and its contents, and suspicion that it may have been part of a disinformation campaign. [ 99 ] [ 100 ] [ 101 ] A Republican activist delivered a portable drive to the Washington Post and stated that the device contained data copied from the laptop. The Post confirmed that some of the materials provided to them were genuine, but could not confirm that the materials on the portable drive came from the purported laptop; the Post also concluded that most of the data could not be verified and fake material may have been mixed in with it. [ 98 ] Hunter Biden said that it is possible the laptop could be his. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] Ukrainian businessman Hares Youssef told The Times that an associate of Dmytro Firtash asked Youssef to lie about Hunter Biden's business dealings to damage Joe Biden's presidential campaign, in exchange for a United States visa. [ 104 ] Subjects of the conspiracy The false allegations asserted that Joe Biden asked for the dismissal of Viktor Shokin to cover up crimes by his son Hunter Biden. [ 25 ] Viktor Shokin Viktor Shokin was appointed to the position of Prosecutor General of Ukraine by Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko , to whom he was loyal. Due to his own corruption and failures to do his job to clean up corruption, representatives of the EU , the United States , the World Bank , and International Monetary Fund , [ 6 ] pressed Poroshenko for his removal. [ 105 ] In March 2016 testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , former ambassador to Ukraine John E. Herbst stated, "By late fall of 2015, the EU and the United States joined the chorus of those seeking Mr. Shokin's removal" and that Joe Biden "spoke publicly about this before and during his December visit to Kyiv". During the same hearing, assistant secretary of state Victoria Nuland stated, "we have pegged our next $1 billion loan guarantee, first and foremost, to having a rebooting of the reform coalition so that we know who we are working with, but secondarily, to ensuring that the prosecutor general's office gets cleaned up." [ 8 ] An overwhelming majority vote in the Ukrainian Parliament in March 2016 led to Shokin's removal from office [ 106 ] after an investigation into extortion of another company led to associates who were found in possession of diamonds, cash and other valuables, [ 107 ] as well as documents and passports belonging to Shokin. [ 108 ] In an August 2023 Fox News interview, Shokin said he was fired as prosecutor general "at the insistence of then-Vice President [Biden] because I was investigating Burisma." One month later, Poroshenko was asked on Fox News for his reaction to Shokin's assertion. Poroshenko responded: First of all, this is a completely crazy person. There is something wrong with him. Second, there is not one single word of truth. And third, I hate the idea to make any comments and to make any intervention in an American election. We have very much enjoyed the bipartisan support, and please, do not use such a person like Shokin to undermine the trust between bipartisan support and Ukraine. The Fox News interviewer responded, "Okay, so that is not true. He didn't get fired because of Joe Biden." Poroshenko confirmed this, adding Shokin was fired by the Ukrainian parliament "for his own statement" and "he played a very dirty game unfortunately." [ 109 ] [ 110 ] Hunter Biden Hunter Biden is a lawyer whose career previously included a period as an executive vice president at MBNA and three years at the United States Department of Commerce . He then worked as a lobbyist until 2006, when George W. Bush appointed him to the board of directors of Amtrak . Hunter Biden resigned from Amtrak in February 2009, shortly after the inauguration of Barack Obama , when his father Joe Biden became vice-president. He resumed lobbying, and was counsel at the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP , until the Ukrainian oil and gas firm Burisma Holdings appointed him to its board of directors in April 2014. [ 111 ] As Hunter Biden had no prior experience in Ukraine or the energy sector, some viewed this as a likely attempt to buy influence via his father, though Hunter Biden was hired to conduct general corporate consulting rather than to provide energy expertise. [ 112 ] Hunter Biden's employment was described by some as a potential conflict of interest , and advisors to the Obama administration considered the situation awkward. [ 113 ] Former Politico reporter Marc Caputo said in January 2025 that in 2019 the campaign of a rival to Biden for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election gave him opposition research on Burisma. "That story was killed by the editors, and they gave no explanation for that either", he recalled, citing it and orders to not report on the laptop as among examples of "dumb decisions of cowardly editors" regarding Hunter Biden. [ 114 ] Congressional investigations After Republicans took control of the House in January 2023, three House committees initiated investigations into Joe Biden, his family, and the Justice Department. In September 2023, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy authorized the committees to open a formal impeachment inquiry , to be led by James Comer , chairman of the House investigation into the Biden family . McCarthy had days earlier said that he would hold a full House vote to authorize an inquiry. [ 115 ] The Washington Post reported that during a November 7 luncheon with the Republican Governance Group , McCarthy's successor Mike Johnson indicated there was insufficient evidence to initiate formal impeachment proceedings . [ 116 ] Johnson said on December 2 that he believed he had enough House votes to continue to impeachment proceedings, as Republicans said a vote might be held within days, though they acknowledged they had not found evidence of misconduct by the president. [ 117 ] [ 118 ] [ 17 ] Lev Parnas testimony At the invitation of committee Democrats, on March 20, 2024, Parnas testified before the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee investigation into the Biden family that was pursuing the impeachment of President Joe Biden . [ 119 ] [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Parnas stated he was tasked by Giuliani with "finding dirt on the Bidens" to "spread misinformation about them" but he was unable to find evidence of Biden corruption in Ukraine. [ 122 ] He testified, in part: [ 123 ] The American people have been lied to, by Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani and various cohorts of individuals in government and media positions. They created falsehoods to serve their own interests knowing it would undermine the strength of our nation ... Congressman Pete Sessions , then-Congressman Devin Nunes , Senator Ron Johnson and many others understood they were pushing a false narrative. The same goes for John Solomon , Sean Hannity and media personnel, particularly with Fox News , who used this narrative to manipulate the public ahead of the 2020 elections. Sadly, they are still doing this today as we approach the 2024 elections ... The only information ever pushed on the Bidens and Ukraine has come from one source and one source only: Russia and Russian agents.

Hunter Biden is expressing regret for being discharged from the Navy Reserve amid published reports that he tested positive for cocaine. The Wall Street Journal reports that Hunter Biden failed the drug test last year and was discharged in February. In a statement issued Thursday, Oct. 16, Biden doesn’t say why he was discharged. He says he’s embarrassed that his actions led to his discharge and that he respects the Navy’s decision.(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File) Read More 2 of 3 | FILE - This Dec. 4, 2013, file photo shows U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, left, arriving on Air Force Two in Beijing, China, with his son Hunter Biden, right, and his granddaughter Finnegan Biden. As the Vice President travels to Ukraine Saturday, June 7, 2014, his youngest son, Hunter, 44, has been hired by a private Ukrainian company that promotes energy independence from Russia, but is commercially active in the breakaway Russian-backed state of Crimea and owned by a former government minister with ties to Ukraine’s ousted pro-Russian president.

(AP Photo/Sergei Chuzavkov) Read More By Stephen Braun Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. Vice President Joe Biden’s visit Saturday to support Ukraine’s fragile democracy came soon after his youngest son was hired by a private Ukrainian company that promotes energy independence from Moscow. Yet that company leases natural gas fields in the breakaway Russian-backed state of Crimea and is owned by a former government minister with ties to Ukraine’s ousted pro-Russian president. The hiring of Hunter Biden, 44, by Burisma Holdings Limited in April was approved by the company’s owner, a former senior minister and political ally of Viktor Yanukovych, the exiled Ukrainian president. Yanukovych fled to Russia in February after protests erupted over his efforts to establish closer economic ties with Moscow. Hunter Biden’s employment means he will be working as a director and top lawyer for a Ukrainian energy company during the period when his father and others in the Obama administration attempt to influence the policies of Ukraine’s new government, especially on energy issues. There’s no indication that Hunter Biden, his father or Burisma are crossing any legal or ethical lines, although ethics experts appear divided over the implications of Hunter Biden’s new job. American conflict-of-interest laws and federal ethics rules essentially do not regulate the business activities of adult relatives of those who work in the White House. “The primary problem here is the fact that Hunter Biden has set up a financial arrangement with someone who might have business pending before this administration,” said Craig Holman, an ethics expert with Public Citizen, a Washington-based government reform organization. Joe Biden led the U.S. delegation at Saturday’s inauguration of Ukraine’s new president, Petro Poroshenko, and announced $48 million in additional aid for the Kiev government. Biden met Poroshenko and said “there is a window for peace and you know as well as anyone that it will not stay open indefinitely ... America is with you.” Ukraine is an important natural-gas and petroleum-liquids transit country. Two major pipeline systems carry Russian gas through Ukraine to Western Europe. Burisma is headed by Nikolai Zlochevskyi, who held senior posts over natural resources, environment and defense in Ukraine. The company has aggressively bought up Ukrainian oil and natural gas leases and companies. Hunter Biden’s new company says it aims to reduce Ukraine’s dependence on Russian gas and oil, a goal that parallels U.S. efforts to aid Ukraine’s energy industry. As a Burisma director and the company’s top lawyer, the younger Biden has yet to take any public actions on behalf of the company. But the timing of his hiring is politically awkward for the administration’s efforts to shore up Ukraine’s pro-Western government, and poses potential complications from Burisma’s growing energy interests and the background of Hunter Biden’s new boss, Zlochevskyi. At least two oil and natural gas fields leased by subsidiaries of Burisma are in Ukrainian territories where pro-Russian sentiments remain strong, according to government and media releases, independent energy maps and Burisma’s website. One is in the breakaway Russian-backed state of Crimea; the other is in the eastern Ukrainian Kharkiv region. Instability there could force the younger Biden’s new company to coordinate with pro-Russian separatists whom the U.S. considers illegitimate. White House officials declined to comment on Hunter Biden’s association with Burisma and the company’s holdings in Crimea and east Ukraine. The vice president’s spokeswoman, Kendra Barkoff, previously said that Biden’s son is a private citizen and a lawyer, and that Joe Biden “does not endorse any particular company and has no involvement with this company.” Presidents and vice presidents have long been vexed by relatives rewarded for family ties. Political loan troubles shadowed Vice President Richard Nixon’s brother, Donald, during the 1960 election, and President Jimmy Carter’s brother, Billy, who accepted a $220,000 stipend in 1981 from Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi. In recent years, several Bush and Clinton relatives were caught in a string of murky financial and political dealings. But “unless there’s solid evidence that Hunter Biden got his job to influence American foreign policy, there’s no clear line that’s been crossed,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. A former Washington lobbyist, the vice president’s son is effectively exempt from most rules that would require him to describe publicly the legal work he does on behalf of Burisma. Hunter Biden will not lobby for the company, said Lawrence Pacheco, an official with FTI Consulting, a Washington government affairs company recently hired by Burisma. Pacheco did not say whether Biden might oversee or advise on any future Burisma lobbying strategy in the U.S. Pacheco said the company “does not take positions on political matters.” But Biden’s company may have to deal with Ukrainian enclaves that the U.S. does not recognize diplomatically or are threatened by instability. One Burisma subsidiary, KrymTopEnergoServis, operates natural gas fields and has headquarters in the Crimea, which seceded from Ukraine this year and now aligns with Russia. A second subsidiary, Esco-Pivnich, produces oil and natural gas just west of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, which was the site of several protests and borders on separatist-controlled provinces. The company’s website confirms that Burisma operates oil and natural gas sites in Crimea and east Ukraine, as well as elsewhere in Ukraine. “While he’s just at the beginning of his involvement with this company, Ukraine is volatile right now and there are all sorts of problems that might crop up down the line,” said Bill Allison, the editorial director of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan watchdog group. Pacheco said the company’s western and eastern operations have been unaffected by Ukraine’s unrest but that its Crimea subsidiary is not operating currently. He did not explain further, but confirmed KrymTopEnergoServis is based and leases gas deposits in Crimea. Hunter Biden, Zlochevskyi and other company officials would not comment publicly, Pacheco said. Hunter Biden is a managing director with Rosemont Seneca Partners, a private equity firm, and worked as a Washington lobbyist for seven years until his father was elected vice president. He lobbied primarily for colleges, hospitals and tech firms. Pacheco said Biden’s son came to Burisma’s attention after he was introduced by Devon Archer, another new Burisma board member, to Alan Apter, Burisma’s board chairman. Archer works with Hunter Biden at Rosemont and was a top fundraiser for now-Secretary of State John Kerry when Kerry ran for president in 2004. Zlochevskyi approved Biden’s hiring, Pacheco said. Zlochevskyi, 48, worked as minister of natural resources and environment under Yanukovych and most recently was deputy secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defense council, which advised Yanukovych on defense matters. Zlochevskyi also served in the Ukrainian parliament from 2007 to 2011 as a member of the Party of Regions, the political party affiliated with Yanukovych and traditionally aligned with pro-Russian interests. Zlochevskyi’s name is missing from Burisma’s web site, but financial documents in Cyprus as well as U.S. Securities and Exchange records show that he owns the bulk of Burisma’s shares. Zlochevskyi’s Cyprus-based Brociti Investments Limited controls Burisma. Hunter Biden joined Burisma in April, the same month his father visited Kiev to show support for the new interim government. ___ Associated Press writers Menelaos Hadjicostis in Nicosia, Cyprus, and Laura Mills in Kiev contributed to this report.

During the 2020 election campaign, he and his father were frequently accused by Donald Trump and his associates of wrongdoing in regards to China and Ukraine, allegations which they both denied. The New York Post reported on an alleged email in which an adviser from a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, apparently thanked Hunter for inviting him to meet his father, Joe Biden. Asked about the allegations, Joe Biden told a reporter it was a "smear campaign". No criminal activity has been proven, and no evidence has emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. In an interview with the BBC months after his father was sworn in as president, Hunter Biden defended his qualifications for the position at Burisma but added that, in retrospect, he had "missed... the perception that I would create". Claims of influence-peddling are common in Washington DC and Mr Trump's children have also been accused of conflicts of interest in lucrative business deals overseas. They, too, deny wrongdoing. What do we know about the federal investigation? The Justice Department is investigating Hunter Biden's finances including scrutinising some of his past Chinese business dealings and other transactions, a "person familiar with the matter" told The Associated Press in December . The tax investigation was launched in 2018 but Hunter Biden said he had learned about it for the first time in December 2020. Asked about the investigation by US broadcaster CBS this April, the president's son said: "I'm co-operating, completely. And I'm absolutely certain, 100% certain, that at the end of the investigation, that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing." What have the Bidens been accused of in China? The New York Post cited a purported email from Hunter Biden in August 2017 indicating he was receiving a $10m annual fee from a Chinese billionaire for "introductions alone", though it is unclear who was involved in the alleged introductions. Another purported email, which Fox News said it had confirmed, reportedly refers to a deal pursued by Hunter involving China's largest private energy firm. It is said to include a cryptic mention of "10 held by H for the big guy". Fox News cited unnamed sources as saying "the big guy" in the purported email was a reference to Joe Biden. This message is said to be from May 2017. Both emails would date from when the former US vice-president was a private citizen. A former business associate of Hunter Biden has come forward to say he can confirm the allegations. Tony Bobulinski told Fox News that, contrary to Joe Biden's statements that he had nothing to do with his son's business affairs, Hunter had "frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals" in China. Mr Bobulinski, who is reportedly a US Navy veteran, separately told Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he had met on two occasions with Joe Biden to discuss business deals with China, the first time in May 2017 when Barack Obama's former vice-president was a private citizen. He says he asked Joe Biden's brother, James, whether the family was concerned about possible scrutiny of the former vice-president's involvement in a potential business deal with a Chinese entity. Mr Bobulinski told Fox News that James Biden had replied: "Plausible deniability." Mr Bobulinski was invited by Mr Trump to be his guest at the final presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee on 22 October. What is known about Hunter's dealings in China? In 2013, Hunter flew aboard Air Force Two with his father, who was then vice-president, on an official visit to Beijing, where the younger Biden met investment banker Jonathan Li. Hunter told the New Yorker he had just met Mr Li for "a cup of coffee", but 12 days after the trip a private equity fund, BHR Partners, was approved by the Chinese authorities. Mr Li was chief executive and Hunter was a board member. He would hold a 10% stake. Getty Images Joe Biden walks out of Air Force Two with his granddaughter and son, Hunter Biden BHR is backed by some of China's largest state banks and by local governments, according to US media. Hunter Biden's lawyer said he had joined the board in an unpaid position "based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets". His lawyer also said his client did not acquire his financial stake in BHR until 2017, after his father had left office in the US. Hunter resigned from the board of BHR in April 2020, but still held his 10% stake in BHR as of July this year, according to the company report. What did the New York Post say about Hunter Biden and Ukraine? The New York Post reported an email from April 2015, in which an adviser to Burisma, Vadym Pozharskyi, apparently thanked Hunter Biden for inviting him to meet his father in Washington. Hunter was a director on the board of Burisma - a Ukrainian-owned private energy company while his father was the Obama administration's pointman on US-Ukrainian relations. Hunter was one of several foreigners on its board. The New York Post article did not provide evidence that the meeting had ever taken place. The Biden election campaign said there was no record of any such meeting on the former vice-president's "official schedule" from the time. But in a statement to Politico , the campaign also acknowledged that Mr Biden could have had an "informal interaction" with the Burisma adviser that did not appear on his official schedule, though it said any such encounter would have been "cursory". "Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague, have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official US policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing," said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr Biden. What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Biden's team has also decried the New York Post story as "Russian disinformation", though it did not say the emails were bogus. The New York Post article was shared by President Trump and his allies. Two of his former advisers, Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani, were involved in providing the story and the hard drive containing the alleged emails, to the newspaper. Mr Giuliani says the messages were found on a laptop that Hunter dropped off at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. Sceptics have noted that Mr Giuliani travelled in December 2019 to Kyiv where he met Ukrainian lawmaker Andriy Derkach, whom the US Treasury has designated as a longtime Kremlin agent. Mr Giuliani has acknowledged trying dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine. But the US Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, told Fox Business that the purported emails were not connected to a Russian disinformation effort. Other US media say they have been unable to verify the authenticity of the emails. Hunter has neither confirmed nor denied that he dropped off a laptop at the location. Hunter joined Burisma in 2014, and remained on the board until April 2019, when he decided to leave. Speaking to the BBC, he said Burisma had seen his name "as gold" and that it had played a large part in his appointment to the board. Twitter and Facebook's action over Joe Biden article reignites bias claims What are the Bidens accused of in Ukraine? Donald Trump and his allies accused Joe Biden of wrongdoing because he had pushed, while vice-president, for the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, who was investigating the company for which Hunter worked. In 2016, Joe Biden called for the dismissal of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin, whose office had Burisma and other companies under investigation. However, other Western leaders and major bodies that give financial support to Ukraine also wanted the prosecutor dismissed because they believed he was not active enough in tackling corruption. What else has the Biden campaign said? Shortly before the final presidential debate last year, the Democrat's camp released a statement denying wrongdoing. "Joe Biden has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever," said the statement. "He has never held stock in any such business arrangements nor has any family member or any other person ever held stock for him. "What is true is that Tony Bobulinski admitted on the record to Breitbart that he is angry that he was *not* able to go into business with Hunter and James Biden [Joe Biden's brother]." What did this have to do with impeachment? In 2019, details emerged of a phone call Mr Trump, the then president, had made to the president of Ukraine, in which he had urged the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens. President Trump's impeachment explained This led to charges by the Democrats that Mr Trump was trying to illegally pressure Ukraine to help damage his election rival, resulting in impeachment by the House of Representatives. Mr Trump denied he had done anything wrong, and he was later acquitted by the Republican-controlled US Senate. Getty Images President Trump holds a copy of The Washington Post the day after the US Senate acquitted him on two articles of impeachment Has anything been proven against the Bidens? While no criminal activity has been proven, it has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. A senior State Department official raised such concerns as far back as 2015. Joe Biden's son defends foreign dealings US Republican lawmakers launched an investigation and found last year that Hunter's work for the Ukrainian firm had been "problematic" - but there wasn't evidence that US foreign policy was influenced by it. No criminal charges were proven against Burisma either. The company issued a statement in 2017 saying "all legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations" against it were closed. Last year, Yuriy Lutsenko, the prosecutor in Ukraine who succeeded Viktor Shokin, told the BBC that there was no reason to investigate the Bidens under Ukrainian law. There is nothing illegal about sitting on a board of a company whilst family members serve in government. Hunter Biden's lawyers said in statement in October 2019 that he had undertaken "these business activities independently. He did not believe it appropriate to discuss them with his father, nor did he." Hunter told the New Yorker magazine that on the only occasion he had mentioned Burisma: "Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing.'" Amid all the scrutiny, Joe Biden promised last year that if he was elected president, no-one in his family would hold a job or have a business relationship with a foreign corporation or foreign government.

He is the second son of former president Joe Biden and his first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden . Hunter Biden was a founding board member of BHR Partners , a Chinese investment company, in 2013, and later served on the board of Burisma Holdings , one of the largest private natural gas producers in Ukraine , from 2014 until his term expired in April 2019. He has worked as a lobbyist and legal representative for lobbying firms, a hedge fund principal, and a venture capital and private equity fund investor. Since early 2019, Hunter and his father have been the targets of false allegations that Joe pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor to protect Hunter , which intensified after the New York Post published an article in October 2020 about a laptop computer that had belonged to Hunter Biden . Biden was convicted of three federal firearms -related felony charges in June 2024 after he had admitted to illegally owning a gun while a drug user. His tax affairs have been under federal criminal investigation since late 2018, and in September 2024, he pled guilty to all of the tax charges. In December 2024, Biden's father pardoned him for all federal offenses committed between 2014 and 2024, including any potential offenses not yet discovered. Early life and education Further information: Biden family Biden as a child, c. 1980s Robert Hunter Biden was born on February 4, 1970, [ 1 ] in Wilmington, Delaware . He is the second son of Neilia Biden (née Hunter) and Joe Biden . [ 2 ] Hunter Biden's mother and younger sister Naomi were killed in an automobile crash on December 18, 1972. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Biden and his older brother Beau were also seriously injured but survived. Beau suffered multiple broken bones while Hunter sustained a fractured skull and severe traumatic brain injuries. [ 5 ] Both spent several months in the hospital, during which time their father was sworn into the U.S. Senate in January 1973. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Hunter and Beau later encouraged their father to marry again, [ 9 ] and Jill Jacobs Stevenson became their stepmother in 1977. [ 2 ] Biden's half-sister Ashley was born in 1981. [ 10 ] Like his father and brother, Biden attended the Catholic high school Archmere Academy in Claymont, Delaware . [ 2 ] He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Georgetown University in 1992. [ 2 ] During the year after he graduated from college, he served as a Jesuit volunteer at a church in Portland, Oregon , and met Kathleen Buhle , whom he married in 1993. [ 2 ] After attending the Georgetown University Law Center for one year, he transferred to Yale Law School and graduated in 1996. [ 2 ] Early career After graduating from law school in 1996, Biden accepted a consultant position at the bank holding company MBNA , whose employees donated more than $200,000 to his father's senate campaigns over the years. [ 2 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Biden delayed his start date at MBNA to serve as co-chair for his father's reelection campaign. [ 13 ] By 1998, Hunter Biden had risen to the rank of executive vice president. [ 2 ] Biden departed from MBNA in 1998. He then served at the United States Department of Commerce , focusing on ecommerce policy for President Bill Clinton's administration . [ 14 ] In 2001, Biden became a lobbyist, co-founding the firm of Oldaker, Biden & Belair. [ 15 ] According to Adam Entous of The New Yorker , Biden and his father established a relationship in which "[Joe] Biden wouldn't ask Hunter about his lobbying clients, and Hunter wouldn't tell his father about them". [ 2 ] In 2001, he was also rehired by MBNA as a consultant, where he was paid a yearly $100,000 retainer until 2005. [ 13 ] MBNA's rehiring of Biden was controversial because his father was pushing for passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act , which was beneficial to the credit card industry and supported by MBNA during Biden's time at the bank. [ 2 ] [ 16 ] The legislation made it more difficult to get bankruptcy protection. [ 16 ] Biden was appointed to a five-year term on the board of directors of Amtrak by President George W. Bush in 2006. [ 17 ] Biden was the board's vice chairman from July 2006 until he was replaced as vice chairman in January 2009. [ 18 ] He resigned from the board that February, [ 19 ] shortly after his father became vice president. Biden said during his father's vice-presidential campaign that it was time for his lobbying activities to end. [ 2 ] Investing, lobbying, and philanthropy In 2006, Biden and his uncle James Biden purchased international hedge fund Paradigm Global Advisors with an $8 million promissory note. [ 15 ] The joint promotion of the fund by an entity of the troubled Stanford Financial Group hastened the unwinding of the company in 2010. [ 20 ] In September 2008, Hunter Biden founded a consultancy company named Seneca Global Advisors that offered to help companies expand into foreign markets. [ 21 ] Biden was a partner in investment vehicles that included the name "Seneca" to denote his participation. [ 22 ] In 2009, Biden, Devon Archer, and Christopher Heinz founded the investment and advisory firm Rosemont Seneca Partners . [ 15 ] Biden also co-founded venture capital firm Eudora Global. [ 10 ] Biden held the position of counsel in the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP in 2014. [ 2 ] From 2011 to 2017, Biden was on the board of directors of World Food Program USA, a 501(c)(3) charity based in Washington, D.C., that supports the work of the UN World Food Programme ; he served as board chairman from 2011 to 2015. [ 23 ] A detailed analysis of Hunter Biden's hard drive by NBC News showed that Biden and his firm were paid $11 million from 2013 to 2018, [ 24 ] including $3.8 million in payments from CEFC China Energy , [ 25 ] a defunct oil and gas company with links to the Chinese Communist Party , [ 26 ] as well as from Burisma Holdings. [ 24 ] In the U.S. criminal tax case against Hunter Biden, prosecutors allege he accepted payments from Romanian businessman Gabriel Popoviciu to influence U.S. government agencies regarding a criminal probe in Romania. Hunter Biden has pleaded guilty on 5 September 2024 to tax evasion and related charges. The allegations date back to his work for Popoviciu in 2015, during Joe Biden's vice presidency. [ 27 ] BHR Partners Main article: BHR Partners From 2013 to 2020, Biden served as a member of the board of the China-based private equity fund BHR Partners , of which he acquired a 10% stake in 2017 at a discount to actual value and with borrowed money. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] The founders of BHR Partners included Biden's Rosemont Seneca Partners investment firm (20% equity), along with US-based Thornton Group LLC (10% equity) and two asset managers registered in China. [ 30 ] [ 2 ] [ 21 ] The Chinese-registered asset managers are the Bank of China (via BOC International Holdings -backed Bohai Industrial Investment Fund Management) and Deutsche Bank -backed Harvest Fund Management . [ 31 ] In September 2019, while President Donald Trump was accusing Hunter Biden of malfeasance in Ukraine, he also falsely claimed that Biden "walk[ed] out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund". [ 32 ] Later in 2019, The Wall Street Journal confirmed that Trump was incorrect in claiming that Hunter received $1.5 billion, stating that Trump had no evidence to support the claim and that he incorrectly interpreted BHR's past fundraising target of $1.5 billion; BHR invested money raised from other companies and did not keep the funds. [ 33 ] Trump publicly called upon China to investigate Hunter Biden's business activities there while his father was vice president. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Hunter Biden announced his resignation from the board of directors of BHR Partners, effective the end of October 2019, citing "the barrage of false charges" by then-U.S. President Trump. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] This was confirmed by Biden's attorney, who said in November 2021 that his client no longer held any direct or indirect interest in BHR. [ 38 ] However, as of April 2020, Chinese business records showed that Hunter Biden remained a board member of BHR. [ 39 ] According to his lawyer, Biden had "not received any compensation for being on BHR's board of directors" nor had he received any return on his equity share in BHR. [ 40 ] Biden's lawyer George Mesires told The Washington Post that BHR Partners had been "capitalized from various sources with a total of 30 million RMB ( Renminbi ), or about $4.2 million, not $1.5 billion". [ 32 ] Biden's solely-owned company Skaneateles LLC owned a 10% equity stake in BHR as of December 2020. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] In November 2021, New York Times reported that "Chinese corporate records show Skaneateles remains a part owner of BHR". [ 38 ] Skaneateles was dissolved in 2022. BHR Partners invests Chinese venture capital into tech startups, such as an early-stage investment in Chinese auto hailing app DiDi [ 33 ] and cross-border acquisitions in automotive and mining, for example, the purchase of a stake in Democratic Republic of Congo copper and cobalt producer Tenke Fungurume Mining . [ 43 ] [ 44 ] The New York Times reported that BHR Partners helped finance a coal-mining company in Australia that was controlled by a Chinese state-owned enterprise , assisted a subsidiary of a Chinese defense company in acquiring an auto parts manufacturer in Michigan, and facilitated the $3.8 billion purchase of the DRC cobalt mine. A former BHR board member told the Times that Biden and the other American BHR founder, Devon Archer , were not involved in the mine deal. [ 38 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Burisma Holdings See also: Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory and Trump–Ukraine scandal In April 2014, Biden joined the board of Burisma Holdings owned by Ukrainian oligarch and former politician Mykola Zlochevsky , who was facing a money laundering investigation just after the Ukrainian revolution . [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] Biden's business partner, Devon Archer, had joined the board of Burisma several months prior. Biden was hired to help Burisma with requesting assistance from the U.S government to expand its business and corporate governance best practices , while still an attorney with Boies Schiller Flexner . A consulting firm in which Biden is a partner was also retained by Burisma. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Christopher Heinz, John Kerry 's stepson, opposed his partners Devon Archer and Hunter Biden joining the board in 2014 due to the reputational risk . [ 48 ] Biden served on the board of Burisma until his term expired in April 2019, [ 52 ] receiving compensation of up to $50,000 per month. [ 52 ] [ 51 ] Because Joe Biden played a major role in U.S. policy towards Ukraine, some Ukrainian anti-corruption advocates [ 54 ] [ 55 ] and Obama administration officials expressed concern that Hunter Biden having joined the board could create the appearance of a conflict of interest and undermine Joe Biden's anti-corruption work in Ukraine. [ 2 ] [ 48 ] While serving as vice president, Joe Biden joined other Western leaders in encouraging the government of Ukraine to fire the country's top prosecutor Viktor Shokin , [ 56 ] [ 57 ] who was widely criticized for blocking corruption investigations. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] The Ukrainian parliament voted to remove Shokin in March 2016. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] Biden lobbied the U.S. State Department on behalf of Burisma to help secure a potentially lucrative energy project in Italy while his father was still Vice President. In 2016, Biden wrote a letter to the U.S. ambassador to Italy, John R. Phillips , which Biden's lawyer described as seeking to arrange an introduction between Burisma and the president of Italy's Tuscany region, the location of a potential Burisma energy project. A businessman involved in Burisma's project said that the outreach was undertaken at a time when Burisma was having difficulty securing regulatory approval for its Tuscany project. Embassy officials who handled the letter were concerned about the son of the sitting vice president reaching out on behalf of a foreign company, and Biden's request for a meeting was ultimately unmet. As President, Joe Biden released records confirming Hunter Biden's lobbying effort after dropping out of his 2024 presidential campaign , and denied being aware of it while vice president. [ 50 ] [ 62 ] Since early 2019, Hunter and his father Joe Biden have been the subjects of false and baseless claims of corrupt activities in a Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory pushed by then-U.S. president Donald Trump and his allies. [ 63 ] Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani claimed in 2019, without evidence, that Joe Biden had sought the dismissal of Shokin in order to protect his son and Burisma Holdings. Actually, it was the official policy of the United States and the European Union to seek Shokin's removal. [ 64 ] [ 54 ] [ 56 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] There has also been no evidence produced of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden in Ukraine. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] The Ukrainian anti-corruption investigation agency stated in September 2019 that its current investigation of Burisma was restricted solely to investigating the period from 2010 to 2012, before Hunter Biden joined Burisma in 2014. [ 69 ] Shokin, in May 2019, claimed that he was fired because he had been actively investigating Burisma, [ 70 ] but U.S. and Ukrainian officials have stated that the investigation into Burisma was dormant at the time of Shokin's dismissal. [ 48 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ] Ukrainian and United States State Department sources note that Shokin was fired for failing to address corruption, including within his office. [ 65 ] [ 55 ] [ 72 ] In July 2019, Trump ordered the freezing of $391 million in military aid [ 73 ] shortly before a telephone conversation with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy in which Trump asked Zelenskyy to initiate an investigation of the Bidens. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] Trump falsely told Zelenskyy that "[Joe] Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution" of his son; Joe Biden did not stop any prosecution, did not brag about doing so, and there is no evidence his son was ever under investigation. [ 76 ] The United States House of Representatives initiated a formal impeachment inquiry on September 24, 2019, against Trump on the grounds that he may have sought to use U.S. foreign aid and the Ukrainian government to damage Joe Biden's 2020 presidential campaign . [ 77 ] Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko said in May 2019 that Hunter Biden had not violated Ukrainian law. After Lutsenko was replaced by Ruslan Riaboshapka as prosecutor general, Lutsenko and Riaboshapka said in September and October 2019 respectively that they had seen no evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. [ 56 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ] During 2019 and 2020, Republican senators Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley investigated Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma, as well as allegations that Democrats colluded with the Ukrainian government to interfere in the 2016 election. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee Republican senator Richard Burr privately expressed concerns to the senators that their inquiries could assist efforts by Russian intelligence to spread disinformation to disrupt American domestic affairs. [ 80 ] American intelligence officials briefed senators in late 2019 about Russian efforts to frame Ukraine for 2016 election interference. [ 81 ] Johnson said he would release findings in spring 2020, as Democrats would be selecting their 2020 presidential nominee, but instead ramped up the investigation at Trump's urging in May 2020, after it became clear that Joe Biden would be the nominee. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] Trump tweeted a press report about the investigations, later stating that he would make allegations of corruption by the Bidens a central theme of his re-election campaign. [ 81 ] Johnson decided in March 2020 against issuing a subpoena for former Ukrainian official Andrii Telizhenko, a Giuliani associate who had made appearances on the pro-Trump cable channel One America News , after the FBI briefed him about concerns Telizhenko could be spreading Russian disinformation. [ 84 ] The State Department revoked Telizhenko's visa in October 2020, and CNN reported the American government was considering sanctioning him as a Russian agent. [ 85 ] CNN reported that Vladislav Davidzon, the editor of Ukrainian magazine The Odessa Review , told CNN that in 2018 Telizhenko offered him money to lobby Republican senators in support of pro-Russian television stations in Ukraine. [ 86 ] When Johnson released the final report on the investigation, it contained no evidence that Joe Biden had pushed for Shokin's removal in order to benefit Hunter or Burisma. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] In June 2020, former Ukrainian prosecutor general Ruslan Riaboshapka stated that an audit of thousands of old case files he had ordered in October 2019 had found no wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. Riaboshapka was described by Zelenskyy as "100 percent my person" during the July 2019 call in which Trump asked him to investigate Biden. [ 89 ] Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Derkach , an associate of Rudy Giuliani with links to Russian intelligence, released in May 2020 alleged snippets of recordings of Joe Biden speaking with Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko during the years Hunter Biden worked for Burisma. [ 90 ] The recordings, which were not verified as authentic and appeared heavily edited, depicted Biden linking loan guarantees for Ukraine to the ouster of the country's prosecutor general. The recordings did not provide evidence to support the ongoing conspiracy theory that Biden wanted the prosecutor fired to protect his son. [ 91 ] Poroshenko denied in June 2020 that Joe Biden ever approached him about Burisma. [ 92 ] [ 93 ] The United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Derkach in September 2020, stating he "has been an active Russian agent for over a decade, maintaining close connections with the Russian Intelligence Services". The Treasury Department added Derkach "waged a covert influence campaign centered on cultivating false and unsubstantiated narratives concerning U.S. officials in the upcoming 2020 Presidential Election" including by the release of "edited audio tapes and other unsupported information with the intent to discredit U.S. officials". [ 94 ] [ 95 ] Close associates of Derkach were also sanctioned by the Treasury Department in January 2021. [ 96 ] United States intelligence community analysis released in March 2021 found that Derkach was among proxies of Russian intelligence who promoted and laundered misleading or unsubstantiated narratives about Biden "to US media organizations, US officials, and prominent US individuals, including some close to former President Trump and his administration". [ 97 ] [ 98 ] Two Republicans on a Senate investigation committee in 2020 claimed that Russian businessperson Yelena Baturina , the wife of former Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov , wire-transferred $3.5 million in 2014 to Rosemont Seneca Thornton, of which Biden had previously been a partner. The Washington Post reported in April 2022 that the partners of Rosemont Seneca Thornton had agreed to dissolve the organization before the 2014 wire transfer, though it continued to be operated by Devin Archer to facilitate real estate transactions for eastern and central Asia investors, while Biden was uninvolved. Archer received the $3.5 million wire from Baturina to purchase property in Brooklyn, New York . [ 22 ] The Senate report cited unspecified confidential documents and gave no evidence that Biden personally accepted the funds. [ 99 ] Biden's attorney denied the report, saying Biden had no financial relationship with Baturina and no stake in the partnership that received the money, nor did he co-found the partnership. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] However, Trump's White House spokeswoman Alyssa Farah repeated the claim, and in a press conference Trump repeatedly asserted that Biden received millions of dollars from the former mayor's wife. [ 99 ] Investigations and federal indictments Main article: Weiss special counsel investigation In December 2020, Biden made a public announcement via his attorney that his tax affairs were under federal criminal investigation. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] The New York Times and CNN described the investigation as having started in late 2018 and being related to potential violations of tax and money laundering laws and Biden's business dealings in foreign countries, principally China. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] The Wall Street Journal reported that Biden had provided legal and consulting services that generated foreign-earned income, citing a Senate Republicans' report that $4.79 million in wire transfers from entities linked to Chinese energy tycoon Ye Jianming and his company, CEFC China Energy , were paying for such services. [ 104 ] The New York Times reported that FBI investigators had been unable to establish sufficient evidence for a prosecution of potential money laundering crimes, including after the seizure of a laptop belonging to Biden, and so the investigation progressed onto tax issues. [ 105 ] [ 106 ] Since October 2021, Hollywood attorney and writer Kevin Morris , who has become an influential adviser/confidant and now financier to Biden, lent Biden more than $6.5 million to pay back taxes, support his family, and fund legal expenses. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] The New York Times reported in March 2022 that, since 2018, Biden and possibly others had been under investigation by federal prosecutors in Delaware, with a grand jury convened to subpoena and hear evidence. The investigation examined payments and gifts Biden or his associates had received from foreign interests and whether Biden had violated the law by not registering as a lobbyist under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). The Times reported it had acquired emails that were authenticated by people familiar with them and the investigation that appeared to come from a laptop belonging to Biden. One April 2014 email, written by Biden to his business partner as their work with Burisma was about to begin, noted that his father, then the vice president who would soon visit Kyiv , should "be characterized as part of our advice and thinking—but what he will say and do is out of our hands". The email also stated that Burisma officials "need to know in no uncertain terms that we will not and cannot intervene directly with domestic policymakers, and that we need to abide by FARA and any other U.S. laws in the strictest sense across the board". Biden wrote that his father's visit "could be a really good thing or it could end up creating too great an expectation. We need to temper expectations regarding that visit." He also wrote that his employer, the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, could help Burisma through "direct discussions at state , energy and NSC [ United States National Security Council ]". Other emails showed Biden and his business partner discussing inviting foreign business associates, including a Burisma executive, to attend an April 2015 dinner in Washington, where the vice president would stop by. [ 109 ] A July 2022 report from CNN authenticated emails which showed that Biden was struggling with large debt and overdue tax bills. [ 110 ] [ 111 ] In October 2022, The Washington Post reported that federal agents had determined months prior that they had assembled enough evidence for a viable criminal case against Biden to charge him with crimes related to making false declarations during a gun purchase, as well as tax-related crimes. The next step was for Delaware U.S. attorney David C. Weiss , a holdover from the Trump administration, [ 112 ] to decide on whether to file such charges. [ 113 ] Federal investigators had also been examining the lobbying firm Blue Star Strategies, which Burisma retained while Biden sat on its board, for possible illegal lobbying of American officials. There was no indication Biden was a subject of the investigation. Blue Star employees said in Senate testimony that Biden was included in emails about the firm's work but that he was not particularly involved. One of the firm's co-founders said Biden did not direct its work. Blue Star's work came after Burisma's owner was criticized by the United States State Department, and the firm's founders testified the firm had merely approached officials to determine the government's views of Burisma. [ 114 ] [ 115 ] On June 20, 2023, in a deal with prosecutors, Biden agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges of failure to pay income tax, and to enter a pretrial diversion program related to a felony gun charge of unlawful possession of a firearm. [ 116 ] [ 117 ] [ 118 ] Prosecutors recommended two years of probation for the tax charges; the gun charge would be dropped at the end of this period if the conditions of the diversion program had been met successfully. [ 112 ] Having the gun charge dropped was conditional on Biden remaining drug-free and never being allowed to own a firearm again. [ 119 ] Biden's attorney said the agreement with prosecutors "resolved" the investigation, though the Justice Department said the investigation was "ongoing". In court on July 26, 2023, federal prosecutors explained that the "ongoing" aspect of the investigation referred to possible charges under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA); FARA requires that anyone who acts on the behalf of a foreign government, e.g. China or Ukraine, must register with the Department of Justice and file regular reports on their activities for that government. [ 120 ] On July 26, the plea deal was rejected by the presiding judge, who cited concerns over immunity Biden might receive from future charges, and gave 30 days to both the government prosecutors and Biden's defense team to provide additional information. [ 119 ] Biden changed his plea from "guilty" to "not guilty". [ 121 ] [ 122 ] On August 8, Weiss requested appointment as a special counsel in the Biden investigation, which attorney general Merrick Garland granted. Garland announced the appointment on August 11, the same day Weiss announced government and Biden attorneys could not reach agreement on a new plea deal. [ 123 ] [ 124 ] The Justice Department said on September 6 that Weiss would ask a grand jury to return an indictment of Biden on a gun charge by September 29. [ 125 ] On September 14, Biden was officially indicted in Delaware on three federal firearms-related charges: two for making false statements on a firearm application form and one for prohibited possession of a firearm. [ 126 ] He was arraigned on October 3 and pleaded not guilty to all charges. [ 127 ] Legal experts noted that prosecutions for these charges are rare. [ 128 ] [ 129 ] In January 2024, prosecutors urged a judge to not dismiss Biden's gun charge, revealing that cocaine residue was found in his gun pouch. [ 130 ] On December 7, 2023, Biden was indicted in California on nine tax charges, including three felony and six misdemeanor offenses. The indictment reads that "The Defendant engaged in a four-year scheme to not pay at least $1.4 million in self-assessed federal taxes he owed for tax years 2016 through 2019." Biden's lawyer said that Biden had repaid his taxes in full prior to the indictment. [ 131 ] [ 132 ] On January 11, 2024, Biden pleaded not guilty to the tax charges. [ 133 ] [ 134 ] The same day, U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi scheduled the trial for June 20, 2024. [ 135 ] [ 134 ] The trial was later delayed to September 5, 2024, due to the "needs of the defendant" in preparing for his Delaware trial on firearms charges in June. [ 136 ] Biden repeatedly sought to dismiss both tax and gun charges against him, without success. [ 137 ] [ 138 ] In August 2024, prosecutors alleged that Biden agreed to lobby on behalf of a Romanian businessman seeking to "influence U.S. government agencies" while his father was vice president. The businessman, Gabriel Popoviciu, was under criminal investigation in Romania at the time and hired Biden to assist in fighting his criminal charges through the US government. Prosecutors sought to introduce evidence from Biden's work with Popoviciu as part of his charges on tax evasion. [ 139 ] [ 140 ] A pre-trial hearing for the tax indictment which involved Biden's lawyers would be held on August 21, 2024. [ 141 ] Firearms trial and convictions A final pre-trial hearing for the gun charges was held on May 24, 2024. [ 142 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ] During the final hearing, Judge Maryellen Noreika ruled that prosecutors could not refer to his upcoming California tax trial, child support proceedings in Arkansas, his discharge from the Navy, or include statements which Biden made at a July 2023 hearing where his plea deal collapsed. [ 143 ] However, the prosecution was permitted to bring up Biden's drug use, portions of his memoir, and a summary of data from his laptop, phone, and iPad . [ 143 ] [ 145 ] Biden's trial began on June 3, 2024, on charges of unlawfully possessing a gun as a drug user, lying on a federal form when he bought the gun, and making a false statement about information required to be collected by a federally licensed gun dealer. The charges stemmed from a gun purchased and possessed by Biden in October 2018. During the trial, three of Biden's former partners testified regarding Biden's drug usage and gun purchase. [ 145 ] On June 11, Biden was found guilty on three felony charges for federal gun violations. [ 146 ] [ 147 ] The conviction made Biden the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be convicted in a criminal trial. [ 148 ] Due to his conviction on felony charges, Biden's license to practice law in Washington, D.C. was suspended. [ 149 ] Biden was scheduled to be sentenced on December 12, 2024, which did not occur due to him being pardoned by his father on December 1. [ 150 ] Tax indictment and guilty pleas On September 5, 2024, Biden's defense lawyer Abbe Lowell revealed that Biden would change his plea from not guilty to guilty in the federal tax case. [ 151 ] Biden had been indicted with three felony charges– one tax evasion count and two counts of filing false returns – and six misdemeanor charges. [ 152 ] It was not immediately clear if the presiding Judge Mark C. Scarsi would accept this plea proposal, which would be regarded as an Alford plea . [ 153 ] Under this proposed plea agreement, Biden would have accepted both a sentence and the strength of evidence against him, but also maintained his innocence. [ 154 ] [ 153 ] Later in the day, it was reported that this plea offer would not be accepted by the prosecution. [ 155 ] Initially, Judge Scarsi would neither accept the initial plea offer or call off the trial, but also did not make a final ruling and would opt to make a decision about the plea offer at a later time. [ 154 ] [ 156 ] Prosecutors said they would reject an Alford plea. [ 157 ] However, Scarsi would accept a guilty plea by the end of the day, with Biden pleading guilty to all nine charges. [ 158 ] During his plea hearing, Biden responded "Yes" after Scarsi asked him "Do you agree you committed every element of the charges in the indictment?" [ 158 ] Biden was scheduled to be sentenced on December 16, 2024 and he could have faced up to 17 years in prison. Former federal prosecutor, Tom Dupree, told CBS News he expected the judge to impose a sentence of fewer than five years. President Biden, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, First Lady Jill Biden, and White House spokesperson Andrew Bates repeatedly stated that the president would decline to pardon Hunter or commute his sentence. [ 158 ] [ 150 ] Pardon of criminal offenses Pardon dated December 1, 2024 On December 1, 2024, President Biden issued a full and unconditional pardon for his son. The pardon covered all federal offenses committed between January 1, 2014, and December 1, 2024, and included his tax charges, gun charges, and any other potential charges within that time. In an official White House statement from President Biden, he said that he believed his son was "selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted", and blamed political pressure for the failure of a plea deal for Hunter. [ 159 ] [ 160 ] He concluded by saying "I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision." The New York Times reported that the plea deal fell apart due to the presiding judge questioning its unusual construction, which violated a basic tenet of federal guilty pleas against having side deals in the plea agreement. [ 161 ] In court filings subsequent to the pardon, special counsel Weiss stated "there was none and never has been any evidence of vindictive or selective prosecution in this case". [ 162 ] Judge Scarsi stated that President Biden's characterizations "stand in tension with the case record" and that the Constitution does not "give the president the authority to rewrite history[.]" [ 163 ] The scope of the pardon was unusually broad and legal experts could recall only Richard Nixon as someone given similar terms for a pardon , for a term between 1969 and 1974. [ 164 ] [ 165 ] [ 150 ] The breadth of the pardon includes Hunter Biden's "entire tenure on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, as well as much of his other international work, including in China." [ 166 ] The pardon received bipartisan criticism from members of Congress as harming the justice system. [ 167 ] [ 168 ] In the months leading up to Hunter's scheduled sentencing, the President had made repeated statements that he would not use the pardon authority for his own son. He and his staff continued to state that there would be no pardon for Hunter as late as November, although internal staff discussions affirmed that the option for a pardon would remain on the table even as Biden publicly stated otherwise. [ 169 ] [ 150 ] Hunter issued the following statement in response to the pardon: I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction – mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport, I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering. [ 170 ] Laptop files Main article: Hunter Biden laptop controversy Hunter with his sister Ashley , at their father's inauguration, January 2021. Discovery of Hunter Biden's laptop was an October surprise prior to the 2020 election. [ 171 ] On October 14, 2020, twenty days prior to the 2020 United States presidential election , the New York Post published an article based on content provided to the publication by Donald Trump 's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and former chief strategist Steve Bannon . The article concerned what the Post said was a laptop computer that had belonged to Hunter Biden and that was allegedly left for repairs at a Wilmington, Delaware , computer shop. According to the narrative in the Post article, this device contained an email that referenced a "meeting" between Joe Biden and Vadym Pozharskyi, a Burisma advisor. [ 172 ] The article's veracity was strongly questioned at the time by many mainstream media outlets as well as dozens of current and former intelligence officials for possibly being a Russian disinformation campaign. [ 173 ] [ 174 ] (As of March 25, 2022, Vox reported that there was no evidence to corroborate the intelligence officials' suspicions that the laptop leak was part of a "Russian plot". [ 171 ] ) In January 2024, federal prosecutors stated that they had possession of a laptop computer which Hunter Biden left at the computer store and confirmed that the device contained files also found in cloud backups to Biden's Apple account. [ 175 ] In June 2024, the laptop and its contents were utilized as evidence during a federal court trial of Hunter Biden for firearms charges. FBI investigators testified at the trial, confirming the authenticity of the laptop, and stating that they had cross-referencing texts, emails, and messages found on the laptop with Apple and had verified the serial number on the laptop. Prosecutors also introduced the invoice from the repair shop as evidence. [ 176 ] [ 177 ] Biden was deposed by the House Judiciary and Oversight committees on February 28, 2024, which discussed emails found on the laptop. Biden stated during the deposition that he did not recall sending the laptop for repairs. [ 178 ] [ 179 ] In February 2023, Hunter Biden's attorneys wrote to the Justice Department National Security Division asking that they criminally investigate "individuals for whom there is considerable reason to believe violated various federal laws in accessing, copying, manipulating, and/or disseminating Mr. Biden's personal computer data". A similar letter was sent to the Attorney General of Delaware . The letters named Giuliani, Bannon, Mac Isaac (owner of the Wilmington computer repair shop where the laptop was abandoned), and others. [ 180 ] [ 181 ] The special counsel assigned to the case later described Hunter Biden's claim of right-wing bias as "fiction designed for a Hollywood script". [ 175 ] Another event resulting from discovery of the laptop occurred in January 2023: an anonymous Twitter account posted a rental application found on the laptop, leading to a false claim that in 2018 Hunter Biden had paid rent while residing at his father's Delaware home, where classified documents had been found . James Comer , chair of the House Oversight Committee that was investigating the Biden family , inquired whether it was evidence that Hunter Biden illicitly provided money from his foreign business activities to his father. The document was determined to be a quarterly rental payment for office space at the House of Sweden in Washington, D.C. [ 182 ] Navy Reserve Biden's application for a position in the U.S. Navy Reserve was approved in May 2013. [ 183 ] At age 43, Biden was accepted as part of a program that allows a limited number of applicants with desirable skills to receive commissions and serve in staff positions. [ 184 ] Biden received an age-related waiver and a waiver for a past drug-related incident; he was sworn in as a direct commission officer by his father in a White House ceremony. [ 183 ] [ 2 ] Results of a routine urinalysis taken on Biden's first weekend of reserve duty revealed cocaine in his system. [ 2 ] [ 184 ] He was discharged administratively in February 2014. [ 184 ] [ 185 ] Biden attributed the result to having smoked a cigarette that he had asked a group of men outside a store to give him, claiming the cigarette contained cocaine as well as tobacco. [ 2 ] He did not appeal the discharge, stating that he thought it unlikely the panel would believe his explanation given his history of drug addiction. [ 186 ] [ 2 ] Biden also stated that he did not appeal due to the likelihood that this would result in the press becoming aware of the discharge; however, it was eventually disclosed to The Wall Street Journal by a Navy official. [ 2 ] [ 183 ] Work as an artist In February 2020, The New York Times reported that Biden had been painting as an "undiscovered artist" in his Hollywood Hills home. The report also displayed some of his paintings, including "Untitled #4 (a study in ink)" and "Untitled #3 (a signed work)". [ 187 ] Biden's art dealer, Georges Bergès, hosted a private viewing for Biden in Los Angeles in fall 2021, followed by an exhibition in New York. [ 188 ] Biden's paintings were put up for sale for as much as $500,000 per painting, with Kevin Morris purchasing $875,000 worth of his art. [ 189 ] Another buyer was Elizabeth Hirsh Naftali, a prominent California Democratic Party donor who was appointed to the U.S. Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad by Joe Biden. Business Insider was unable to verify how much Hirsh Naftali spent on the art, nor whether the purchase occurred before or after her appointment. An ethicist interviewed by the news website said that the purchase was ethically problematic, particularly if it occurred before her appointment, as "it might be perceived as a quid pro quo ." [ 190 ] The purchases provoked concerns about possible conflicts of interest and a lack of transparency. [ 191 ] [ 192 ] According to court filings by Biden, between December 2021 and December 2023, he sold approximately $1.5 million of his art. [ 193 ] From December 2023 to March 2025, he sold $36,000 of art. [ 193 ] Presidency of Joe Biden During his father's presidency, Hunter emerged as one of six key individuals who insulated Joe from scrutiny and acted as an intermediary between him and others. [ 194 ] After a poor presidential debate performance by Joe in June 2024 caused intensified public concern about his age and fitness for the presidency, Hunter helped Joe with speech preparation and began joining meetings with the president and his staffers. [ 195 ] Hunter maintained daily, often hourly contact with his father on calls. Joe increasingly relied on Hunter for advice, and Hunter emerged as one of the strongest voices in Joe's circle urging him not to drop out of his reelection campaign . [ 196 ] [ 197 ] [ 198 ] [ 199 ] Hunter had been a regular presence in public White House events, but his increased involvement in Biden's presidency and campaign led to surprise and concern from White House staffers. After Joe's poor debate performance, Hunter advocated for Joe to fire some of his top staffers, including Anita Dunn and Bob Bauer . Hunter also began acting as a "de facto gatekeeper" for access to the president. [ 197 ] [ 199 ] [ 200 ] Litigation Between 2023 and 2024, Hunter privately sued numerous individuals, organizations, and the U.S. Government alleging various instances of invasion of privacy and defamation. In September 2023, Biden filed suit against the IRS , claiming unlawful disclosures of his tax return information in relation to two IRS employees who provided information to members of Congress. [ 201 ] The D.C. District Court dismissed his claim under the Privacy Act in September 2024, and Biden dropped the suit altogether in 2025. [ 202 ] In 2023, Biden sued Garrett Ziegler 's Marco Polo organization, accusing the group of invasion of privacy for publishing 128,000 of his emails that were recovered from his lost laptop computer. [ 203 ] In March 2025, Biden sought to have the case dismissed due to his worsening personal financial situation and inability to continue to pay for his own legal representation. [ 203 ] In 2024, Biden sued Rudy Giuliani alleging Giuliani was responsible for the "total annihilation" of his privacy due to his involvement in releasing data from his laptop computer. [ 204 ] He dropped the lawsuit shortly thereafter. [ 204 ] The same year, he sued Fox News for airing images taken from the laptop, but dropped the lawsuit without explanation the following month. [ 205 ] Three months later, however, he resurrected the lawsuit in state court. [ 206 ] In a statement, Fox News described the second lawsuit as "devoid of any merit". [ 206 ] Later life Following the presidency of Joe Biden, according to The Daily Beast , Hunter fell "on hard times". [ 207 ] The prior year — in 2024 — his law license had been suspended, NBC News noting at the time that it was unclear what impact the suspension would have on his livelihood. [ 208 ] In January 2025, his rental home was damaged and left uninhabitable during the Palisades Fire and he had difficulty finding new housing, resulting in him experiencing homelessness. By this point, he was several million dollars in debt and his income severely impacted by flagging interest in his memoir, which was selling less than 200 copies per month. In court filings, Biden averred that he had anticipated earning money from invitations for paid speaking engagements, but no such invitations had materialized. [ 207 ] [ 209 ] In March 2025, Hunter's Secret Service detail was withdrawn on the direction of Donald Trump. Prior to the end of his term, Joe Biden had ordered an extended period of post-presidency protection for Hunter. [ 210 ] Personal life Relationships Biden (center) with family at his brother Beau's funeral in June 2015 In 1993, Biden married Kathleen Buhle . [ 2 ] They have three daughters: Naomi (named after Biden's sister), [ 211 ] Finnegan, and Maisey. [ 10 ] The couple formally separated in October 2015, and divorced in 2017. [ 212 ] [ 213 ] Buhle's 2022 memoir If We Break documents her account of the relationship. [ 214 ] Biden began a relationship with his brother's widow Hallie Olivere Biden in 2016. [ 215 ] [ 2 ] The relationship ended in 2019. [ 2 ] [ 216 ] [ 217 ] Between 2017 and 2018, Biden also had a romantic relationship with Zoë Kestan . [ 217 ] Biden has a fourth daughter, born in August 2018 in Arkansas , to Lunden Alexis Roberts. [ 218 ] [ 219 ] Biden initially denied that the child was his, but a DNA test , conducted as part of a paternity suit filed in May 2019 by Roberts, confirmed he is the father. The lawsuit was settled in March 2020 after Biden agreed to pay Roberts $20,000 a month in child support. [ 220 ] [ 221 ] Biden filed a motion in September 2022 to reduce his child support payments, on the basis of reduced income; Roberts opposed this request and also petitioned the Arkansas court to change the child's surname to Biden, so that his daughter might benefit from associations with Biden's family. [ 222 ] In June 2023, Biden and Roberts settled the dispute. As part of the settlement, Biden agreed to give several of his paintings to his daughter and pay an undisclosed monthly amount in child support until the daughter turns 18. Biden also agreed to assist with college tuition. Roberts agreed to drop her petition to change their daughter's surname. [ 223 ] [ 224 ] [ 225 ] The matter received significant attention in the media. [ 226 ] Biden married South African filmmaker Melissa Cohen in May 2019, within a week of first meeting her. [ 186 ] [ 227 ] Their son, named Beau in honor of Biden's brother, was born in March 2020 in Los Angeles.

"He really had no substantial Ukraine experience, no Ukraine experience, and no substantial experience in the energy sector at that stage in his career," Entous said. "So, you know, the suspicion was among people who worked for Joe Biden and some State Department and White House officials was this was an effort on the part of Burisma to curry favor." Entous also said the perceived conflict of interest over Hunter Biden's connection to the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma while his father served as vice president is "a legitimate subject of scrutiny." "There's (sic) two separate issues here," Entous said. "The issue of whether it was wise of Hunter Biden to take this position at Burisma when his father was guiding policy in Ukraine and, you know, the wisdom of Biden staffers, once they knew that, not to ask Hunter to step down." "I think that's a legitimate subject of scrutiny." Entous said the other issue is whether Joe Biden used his office as vice president to pressure the Ukrainian government into firing a prosecutor who was looking into Burisma. House Democrats have opened an impeachment inquiry into President Trump over a phone conversation in which he appears to have asked the Ukrainian president to open an investigation into Biden's conduct in Ukraine and his role in the prosecutor's dismissal. The reporter said he had looked into the issue but had "found no evidence to back up and a lot of evidence to the contrary." Over the summer, Entous wrote an extensive profile of Hunter Biden's troubles and how they could affect his father's presidential campaign. In the profile, Hunter said he discussed his position on the board of the Ukrainian gas company once with his father: In December, 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter’s relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration’s special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden, but did not go so far as to recommend that Hunter leave the board. As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: "Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do.’" The New York Times reported that Biden's campaign is pushing back aggressively against claims of misconduct. During an encounter with a reporter who asked Biden about his son, the former vice president forcefully told the reporter to "ask the right questions."

While framed by the president as addressing Hunter’s gun and tax charges, the pardon stunningly covers all crimes Hunter “committed or may have committed” from 2014 to 2023, a period covering Hunter’s questionable business dealings in Ukraine, China, and other foreign nations. In 2014, Hunter began receiving $1 million annually from Burisma, a company controlled by a Ukrainian oligarch which dealt in energy holdings, an industry with which Hunter had no relevant experience. Also, in February 2014, then-Vice-President Joe Biden dined with Russian and Kazakhstani oligarchs who were shortly thereafter responsible for millions of dollars in suspect money transfers including $142,300 which appears to have covered the cost of a car for Hunter. Rather than supporting the integrity of the legal system, by issuing this pardon, President Biden did the opposite and instead decided to put family above fairness to American taxpayers and law-abiding citizens. This is an unacceptable abuse of presidential powers. It has been said, “eternal vigilance is the price of liberty," and after the historic inflation, regulatory overreach, and failures of leadership we’ve seen throughout the Biden-Harris administration, it is clear reining in the excesses of the federal government has never been more urgent. As Republicans look forward to advancing sound policy for the American people in the coming year, we are preparing to deliver government accountability to the taxpayers, families, and small businesses which make up the backbone of our economy. This week, the office of Sen. Joni Ernst released a report showing only 6 percent of the more than two million federal employees work completely in-person rather than telework or remote work. Meanwhile, leasing, maintenance, and operations for federal office buildings costs taxpayers approximately $15.7 billion annually. This is the reason I supported the SHOW UP Act in 2023 to require federal agency employees to show up for work and get back to the business of serving the American people. Unfortunately, the bill has been ignored by Democrats in the Senate and White House. I am eager to ensure the government works more efficiently for the American people and welcome the opportunity to work toward this goal with Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and President Trump’s newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) which aims to address wasteful federal spending and bureaucratic bloat in the coming year. The IRS will be a good place for DOGE’s work to start. Overhauling the IRS requires new leadership. I applaud President Trump’s announcement of his plan to remove the current Commissioner Danny Werfel and nominate my former colleague, Billy Long to fill the role. Despite his commitments to “world-class customer service” and “to roll up [his] sleeves to help working families” during his confirmation process, Commissioner Werfel’s tenure at the IRS has instead focused on advancing the Biden-Harris agenda to intrude further into the financial privacy of American families and small businesses. We need an IRS commissioner who will restore accountability to the agency and its employees, ensure unelected bureaucrats do not harass Americans on the basis of ideology as it did under the Obama administration, simplify tax compliance, protect taxpayer data and privacy, update antiquated technology systems, return to wholly appropriated funding, end the unlawful Direct File Program, and have a true focus on serving taxpayers well. I hope Rep. Long will demonstrate his capacity to do this as the Senate considers his nomination. To combat inflation caused by overspending, clean up the morass of overregulation, and hold those entrusted with power accountable, we need to refocus and repair how the federal government serves Americans. In many ways this looks like getting Washington out of the way and allowing the American people do what they do best. President Ronald Reagan famously said, “the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government, and I'm here to help.” It’s about time we restore accountability and focus on efficiency governmentwide. ### Issues : Economy Taxes Office Locations Washington DC Office 502 Cannon HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-6435 Fax: (202) 225-0207 Nebraska City District Office 202 South 8th Street Suite A Nebraska City, NE 68410 Phone: (402) 874-6050 Fax: (402) 874-6049 Grand Island District Office 1811 West Second Street Suite 275 Grand Island, NE 68803 Phone: (308) 384-3900 Fax: (308) 384-3902 Scottsbluff District Office 416 Valley View Dr. Suite 600 Scottsbluff, NE 69361 Phone: (308) 633-6333 Fax: (308) 633-6335 Copyright Privacy House.gov Accessibility RSS

During the 2020 election campaign, he and his father were frequently accused by Donald Trump and his associates of wrongdoing in regards to China and Ukraine, allegations which they both denied. The New York Post reported on an alleged email in which an adviser from a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, apparently thanked Hunter for inviting him to meet his father, Joe Biden. Asked about the allegations, Joe Biden told a reporter it was a "smear campaign". No criminal activity has been proven, and no evidence has emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. In an interview with the BBC months after his father was sworn in as president, Hunter Biden defended his qualifications for the position at Burisma but added that, in retrospect, he had "missed... the perception that I would create". Claims of influence-peddling are common in Washington DC and Mr Trump's children have also been accused of conflicts of interest in lucrative business deals overseas. They, too, deny wrongdoing. What do we know about the federal investigation? The Justice Department is investigating Hunter Biden's finances including scrutinising some of his past Chinese business dealings and other transactions, a "person familiar with the matter" told The Associated Press in December . The tax investigation was launched in 2018 but Hunter Biden said he had learned about it for the first time in December 2020. Asked about the investigation by US broadcaster CBS this April, the president's son said: "I'm co-operating, completely. And I'm absolutely certain, 100% certain, that at the end of the investigation, that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing." What have the Bidens been accused of in China? The New York Post cited a purported email from Hunter Biden in August 2017 indicating he was receiving a $10m annual fee from a Chinese billionaire for "introductions alone", though it is unclear who was involved in the alleged introductions. Another purported email, which Fox News said it had confirmed, reportedly refers to a deal pursued by Hunter involving China's largest private energy firm. It is said to include a cryptic mention of "10 held by H for the big guy". Fox News cited unnamed sources as saying "the big guy" in the purported email was a reference to Joe Biden. This message is said to be from May 2017. Both emails would date from when the former US vice-president was a private citizen. A former business associate of Hunter Biden has come forward to say he can confirm the allegations. Tony Bobulinski told Fox News that, contrary to Joe Biden's statements that he had nothing to do with his son's business affairs, Hunter had "frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals" in China. Mr Bobulinski, who is reportedly a US Navy veteran, separately told Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he had met on two occasions with Joe Biden to discuss business deals with China, the first time in May 2017 when Barack Obama's former vice-president was a private citizen. He says he asked Joe Biden's brother, James, whether the family was concerned about possible scrutiny of the former vice-president's involvement in a potential business deal with a Chinese entity. Mr Bobulinski told Fox News that James Biden had replied: "Plausible deniability." Mr Bobulinski was invited by Mr Trump to be his guest at the final presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee on 22 October. What is known about Hunter's dealings in China? In 2013, Hunter flew aboard Air Force Two with his father, who was then vice-president, on an official visit to Beijing, where the younger Biden met investment banker Jonathan Li. Hunter told the New Yorker he had just met Mr Li for "a cup of coffee", but 12 days after the trip a private equity fund, BHR Partners, was approved by the Chinese authorities. Mr Li was chief executive and Hunter was a board member. He would hold a 10% stake. Getty Images Joe Biden walks out of Air Force Two with his granddaughter and son, Hunter Biden BHR is backed by some of China's largest state banks and by local governments, according to US media. Hunter Biden's lawyer said he had joined the board in an unpaid position "based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets". His lawyer also said his client did not acquire his financial stake in BHR until 2017, after his father had left office in the US. Hunter resigned from the board of BHR in April 2020, but still held his 10% stake in BHR as of July this year, according to the company report. What did the New York Post say about Hunter Biden and Ukraine? The New York Post reported an email from April 2015, in which an adviser to Burisma, Vadym Pozharskyi, apparently thanked Hunter Biden for inviting him to meet his father in Washington. Hunter was a director on the board of Burisma - a Ukrainian-owned private energy company while his father was the Obama administration's pointman on US-Ukrainian relations. Hunter was one of several foreigners on its board. The New York Post article did not provide evidence that the meeting had ever taken place. The Biden election campaign said there was no record of any such meeting on the former vice-president's "official schedule" from the time. But in a statement to Politico , the campaign also acknowledged that Mr Biden could have had an "informal interaction" with the Burisma adviser that did not appear on his official schedule, though it said any such encounter would have been "cursory". "Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague, have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official US policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing," said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr Biden. What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Biden's team has also decried the New York Post story as "Russian disinformation", though it did not say the emails were bogus. The New York Post article was shared by President Trump and his allies. Two of his former advisers, Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani, were involved in providing the story and the hard drive containing the alleged emails, to the newspaper. Mr Giuliani says the messages were found on a laptop that Hunter dropped off at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. Sceptics have noted that Mr Giuliani travelled in December 2019 to Kyiv where he met Ukrainian lawmaker Andriy Derkach, whom the US Treasury has designated as a longtime Kremlin agent. Mr Giuliani has acknowledged trying dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine. But the US Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, told Fox Business that the purported emails were not connected to a Russian disinformation effort. Other US media say they have been unable to verify the authenticity of the emails. Hunter has neither confirmed nor denied that he dropped off a laptop at the location. Hunter joined Burisma in 2014, and remained on the board until April 2019, when he decided to leave. Speaking to the BBC, he said Burisma had seen his name "as gold" and that it had played a large part in his appointment to the board. Twitter and Facebook's action over Joe Biden article reignites bias claims What are the Bidens accused of in Ukraine? Donald Trump and his allies accused Joe Biden of wrongdoing because he had pushed, while vice-president, for the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, who was investigating the company for which Hunter worked. In 2016, Joe Biden called for the dismissal of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin, whose office had Burisma and other companies under investigation. However, other Western leaders and major bodies that give financial support to Ukraine also wanted the prosecutor dismissed because they believed he was not active enough in tackling corruption. What else has the Biden campaign said? Shortly before the final presidential debate last year, the Democrat's camp released a statement denying wrongdoing. "Joe Biden has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever," said the statement. "He has never held stock in any such business arrangements nor has any family member or any other person ever held stock for him. "What is true is that Tony Bobulinski admitted on the record to Breitbart that he is angry that he was *not* able to go into business with Hunter and James Biden [Joe Biden's brother]." What did this have to do with impeachment? In 2019, details emerged of a phone call Mr Trump, the then president, had made to the president of Ukraine, in which he had urged the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens. President Trump's impeachment explained This led to charges by the Democrats that Mr Trump was trying to illegally pressure Ukraine to help damage his election rival, resulting in impeachment by the House of Representatives. Mr Trump denied he had done anything wrong, and he was later acquitted by the Republican-controlled US Senate. Getty Images President Trump holds a copy of The Washington Post the day after the US Senate acquitted him on two articles of impeachment Has anything been proven against the Bidens? While no criminal activity has been proven, it has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. A senior State Department official raised such concerns as far back as 2015. Joe Biden's son defends foreign dealings US Republican lawmakers launched an investigation and found last year that Hunter's work for the Ukrainian firm had been "problematic" - but there wasn't evidence that US foreign policy was influenced by it. No criminal charges were proven against Burisma either. The company issued a statement in 2017 saying "all legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations" against it were closed. Last year, Yuriy Lutsenko, the prosecutor in Ukraine who succeeded Viktor Shokin, told the BBC that there was no reason to investigate the Bidens under Ukrainian law. There is nothing illegal about sitting on a board of a company whilst family members serve in government. Hunter Biden's lawyers said in statement in October 2019 that he had undertaken "these business activities independently. He did not believe it appropriate to discuss them with his father, nor did he." Hunter told the New Yorker magazine that on the only occasion he had mentioned Burisma: "Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing.'" Amid all the scrutiny, Joe Biden promised last year that if he was elected president, no-one in his family would hold a job or have a business relationship with a foreign corporation or foreign government.

Trump (1st Term) 45th President of the United States: 2017 ‐ 2021 Trump Campaign Press Release - FACT: Shady Foreign Sources Threw Money At Deadbeat Hunter Biden While His Father Was Vice President September 29, 2020 Joe Biden and his family are stone cold corrupt. For decades, career politicians like Joe Biden have used their positions and power to enrich themselves and their family members at the expense of working-class Americans. A vote for Joe Biden is a vote to return to the failed, corrupt status quo. While Biden was vice president, his son Hunter jetted around the world with him, cashing in on shady business deals with Ukrainian, Russian, and Chinese nationals. Why did so many foreign sources throw so much money at a deadbeat like Hunter? Russian billionaire Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow, sent a $3.5 million wire transfer to Hunter Biden's company on Valentine's Day in 2014. Despite having zero experience in the energy sector, Hunter Biden and his firm were paid millions of dollars by a corrupt Ukrainian gas company for a no-show job while his father was in charge of America's foreign policy on Ukraine. Hunter landed the sweetheart gig within weeks of his father's visit to Ukraine. In 2013, Hunter hitched a ride on Air Force Two with Joe Biden to China. While in Beijing, the vice president met with his son's Chinese business partner. 10 days after this trip, Hunter's firm inked a deal with the Chinese government that was potentially worth $1.5 billion. Hunter Biden still has a 10% stake in the Chinese equity firm BHR Partners, which has invested in facial recognition technology used by the Chinese regime to surveil its Muslim population. A Chinese oil tycoon began courting Hunter Biden in 2015 and gave him a 2.8 carat diamond. Hunter opened a joint bank account with a Chinese national tied to the Communist government. The account financed a $100,000 global spending spree for Hunter as well as Joe Biden's brother James and his wife Sara. Donald J.

At the same time those meetings occurred, Archer was negotiating Hunter Biden’s position on the board of directors of Burisma – a Ukrainian company – whose executives implied his value to their company was his influence with his father. They even acknowledged the sensitive optics surrounding his appointment to the company’s board, and discussed the need to make his appointment public only after then-Vice President Biden’s first official trip to Ukraine concluded. April 15, 2014: Devon Archer meets with Vice President Biden at the White House. April 16, 2014: Hunter Biden has coffee with Greg Schultz, Senior Advisor to Vice President Biden. Later that same day, Hunter Biden meets with Devon Archer at the White House. April 17, 2014: A Burisma executive emails Devon Archer stating, as it relates to Hunter Biden, “ I do believe we have to reach a reasonable balance here ” and acknowledged they were relying on Hunter Biden’s influence with his father and would take into account how to use “ the political weight of our Directors… carefully and strategically. ” The email went on to say they would list Hunter Biden on their website “ after his father left our country” and underlined how Burisma could not, “hide our directors. ” April 21, 2014: Then-Vice President Joe Biden travels to Ukraine. May 12, 2014 : Hunter Biden appointed to Burisma’s board of directors. May 13, 2014: According to emails obtained from the Hunter Biden laptop, Eric Schwerin, another Hunter Biden business associate, directed a photo of Joe Biden and Devon Archer that was taken at the April 15th White House meeting be removed from Burisma’s website at the request of the Vice President’s General Counsel. June 7, 2014: Then-Vice President Joe Biden travels to Ukraine for a second time to attend the inauguration of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. September 24, 2014: Devon Archer forwards an email to Hunter Biden discussing the need to “alert U.S. officials who might be able to influence Ukraine to not adopt such harmful measures.” October 27, 2014: Hunter Biden receives an email from a U.S. government official stating, “Secretary of State may be calling you soon.” November 20, 2014: Then-Vice President Biden visits Ukraine for a third time. December 17, 2014: Eric Schwerin emails Hunter Biden to request then-Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s email address. Chairman Smith said, “It is hard to believe the timing of Hunter Biden’s appointment to the board of Burisma and his father’s multiple official visits to Ukraine are mere coincidence. House Republicans are determined to get to the bottom of the Biden family’s influence peddling scheme, and the American people have a right to know if then-Vice President Biden used his official government position to help his family’s overseas business operations. “Thanks to the IRS whistleblowers we know President Biden lied when he said he had no knowledge and was not involved in his son’s business dealings. It now appears he in fact benefited. We will continue to follow the facts in this investigation and present the truth to the American people.” READ : Bombshell: Ways and Means Releases New Documents Revealing Hunter Biden Selling Access to White House, Investigators Blocked from Pursuing Evidence Related to President Biden READ : ICYMI: Documents Confirm Joe Biden was his Family’s “Only Asset” and “The Brand” READ : ICYMI: New Documents Link Biden Family Influence Peddling Scheme to 23 Countries, Four Continents READ : ICYMI: Hunter Biden’s Business Associates Enjoyed White House Dinners, Flights on Air Force 2 Internships Minority Subscribe Archive Privacy Policy News Twitter Instagram Youtube 1139 Longworth HOB Washington D.C. 20515 | P: (202) 225-3625

The Bidens’ Influence Peddling Timeline - United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability Skip to main content Toggle navigation Search About Chairman James Comer Full Committee Rules Committee Activity Calendar Hearings Letters Markups Reports Forums Subcommittees Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation Economic Growth, Energy Policy, and Regulatory Affairs Government Operations Health Care and Financial Services Military and Foreign Affairs Federal Law Enforcement Delivering on Government Efficiency Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets Media Center Press Releases The Overview Biden Family Investigation The Bidens’ Influence Peddling Timeline Biden's Border Crisis COVID Origins Blow the Whistle The Bidens’ Influence Peddling Timeline Since taking the gavel in January, the Committee on Oversight and Accountability has accelerated its investigation of the Biden family’s domestic and international business practices to determine whether the Biden family has been targeted by foreign actors, President Biden is compromised, and our national security is threatened. Records obtained through the Committee’s subpoenas to date reveal that the Bidens and their associates have received over $20 million in payments from foreign entities. Below is a timeline that details key dates in our investigation. The main points of interest are: 1) Romania: On September 28, 2015, Vice President Biden welcomed Romanian President Klaus Iohannis to the White House. Within five weeks of this meeting, a Romanian businessman involved with a high-profile corruption prosecution in Romania, Gabriel Popoviciu, began depositing a Biden associate’s bank account, which ultimately made their way into Biden family accounts. Popoviciu made sixteen of the seventeen payments, totaling over $3 million, to the Biden associate account while Joe Biden was Vice President. Biden family accounts ultimately received approximately $1.038 million. The total amount from Romania to the Biden family and their associates is over $3 million. 2) China- CEFC: On March 1, 2017—less than two months after Vice President Joe Biden left public office—State Energy HK Limited, a Chinese company, wired $3 million to a Biden associate’s account. This is the same bank account used in the above “Romania” section. After the Chinese company wired the Biden associate account the $3 million, the Biden family received approximately $1,065,692 over a three-month period in different bank accounts. Additionally, the CEFC Chairman gives Hunter Biden a diamond worth $80,000. Lastly, CEFC creates a joint venture with the Bidens in the summer of 2017. The timeline lays out the “WhatsApp” messages and subsequent wires from the Chinese to the Bidens of $100,000 and $5 million. The total amount from China, specifically with CEFC and their related entities, to the Biden family and their associates is over $8 million. 3) Kazakhstan: On April 22, 2014, Kenes Rakishev, a Kazakhstani oligarch used his Singaporean entity, Novatus Holdings, to wire one of Hunter Biden’s Rosemont Seneca entities $142,300. The very next day—April 23, 2014—the Rosemont Seneca entity transferred the exact same amount of money to a car dealership for a car for Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden and Devon Archer would represent Burisma in Kazakhstan in May/June of 2014 as the company attempted to broker a three-way deal among Burisma, the Kazakhstan government, and a Chinese state-owned energy company. 4) Ukraine: Devon Archer joined the Burisma board of directors in spring of 2014 and was joined by Hunter Biden shortly thereafter. Hunter Biden joined the company as counsel, but after a meeting with Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevsky in Lake Como, Italy, was elevated to the board of directors in the spring of 2014. Both Biden and Archer were each paid $1 million per year for their positions on the board of directors. In December 2015, after a Burisma board of directors meeting, Zlochevsky and Hunter Biden “called D.C.” in the wake of mounting pressures the company was facing. Zlochevsky was later charged with bribing Ukrainian officials with $6 million in an attempt to delay or drop the investigation into his company. The total amount from Ukraine to the Biden family and their associates is $6.5 million. 5) Russia: On February 14, 2014, a Russian oligarch and Russia’s richest woman, Yelena Baturina, wired a Rosemont Seneca entity $3.5 million. On March 11, 2014, the wire was split up: $750,000 was transferred to Devon Archer, and the remainder was sent to Rosemont Seneca Bohai, a company Devon Archer and Hunter Biden split equally. In spring of 2014, Yelena Baturina joined Hunter Biden and Devon Archer to share a meal with then-Vice President Biden at a restaurant in Washington, D.C. The total amount from Russia to the Biden family and their associates is $3.5 million.

[ 13 ] MBNA's rehiring of Biden was controversial because his father was pushing for passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act , which was beneficial to the credit card industry and supported by MBNA during Biden's time at the bank. [ 2 ] [ 16 ] The legislation made it more difficult to get bankruptcy protection. [ 16 ] Biden was appointed to a five-year term on the board of directors of Amtrak by President George W. Bush in 2006. [ 17 ] Biden was the board's vice chairman from July 2006 until he was replaced as vice chairman in January 2009. [ 18 ] He resigned from the board that February, [ 19 ] shortly after his father became vice president. Biden said during his father's vice-presidential campaign that it was time for his lobbying activities to end. [ 2 ] Investing, lobbying, and philanthropy In 2006, Biden and his uncle James Biden purchased international hedge fund Paradigm Global Advisors with an $8 million promissory note. [ 15 ] The joint promotion of the fund by an entity of the troubled Stanford Financial Group hastened the unwinding of the company in 2010. [ 20 ] In September 2008, Hunter Biden founded a consultancy company named Seneca Global Advisors that offered to help companies expand into foreign markets. [ 21 ] Biden was a partner in investment vehicles that included the name "Seneca" to denote his participation. [ 22 ] In 2009, Biden, Devon Archer, and Christopher Heinz founded the investment and advisory firm Rosemont Seneca Partners . [ 15 ] Biden also co-founded venture capital firm Eudora Global. [ 10 ] Biden held the position of counsel in the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP in 2014. [ 2 ] From 2011 to 2017, Biden was on the board of directors of World Food Program USA, a 501(c)(3) charity based in Washington, D.C., that supports the work of the UN World Food Programme ; he served as board chairman from 2011 to 2015. [ 23 ] A detailed analysis of Hunter Biden's hard drive by NBC News showed that Biden and his firm were paid $11 million from 2013 to 2018, [ 24 ] including $3.8 million in payments from CEFC China Energy , [ 25 ] a defunct oil and gas company with links to the Chinese Communist Party , [ 26 ] as well as from Burisma Holdings. [ 24 ] In the U.S. criminal tax case against Hunter Biden, prosecutors allege he accepted payments from Romanian businessman Gabriel Popoviciu to influence U.S. government agencies regarding a criminal probe in Romania. Hunter Biden has pleaded guilty on 5 September 2024 to tax evasion and related charges. The allegations date back to his work for Popoviciu in 2015, during Joe Biden's vice presidency. [ 27 ] BHR Partners Main article: BHR Partners From 2013 to 2020, Biden served as a member of the board of the China-based private equity fund BHR Partners , of which he acquired a 10% stake in 2017 at a discount to actual value and with borrowed money. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] The founders of BHR Partners included Biden's Rosemont Seneca Partners investment firm (20% equity), along with US-based Thornton Group LLC (10% equity) and two asset managers registered in China. [ 30 ] [ 2 ] [ 21 ] The Chinese-registered asset managers are the Bank of China (via BOC International Holdings -backed Bohai Industrial Investment Fund Management) and Deutsche Bank -backed Harvest Fund Management . [ 31 ] In September 2019, while President Donald Trump was accusing Hunter Biden of malfeasance in Ukraine, he also falsely claimed that Biden "walk[ed] out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund". [ 32 ] Later in 2019, The Wall Street Journal confirmed that Trump was incorrect in claiming that Hunter received $1.5 billion, stating that Trump had no evidence to support the claim and that he incorrectly interpreted BHR's past fundraising target of $1.5 billion; BHR invested money raised from other companies and did not keep the funds. [ 33 ] Trump publicly called upon China to investigate Hunter Biden's business activities there while his father was vice president. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Hunter Biden announced his resignation from the board of directors of BHR Partners, effective the end of October 2019, citing "the barrage of false charges" by then-U.S. President Trump. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] This was confirmed by Biden's attorney, who said in November 2021 that his client no longer held any direct or indirect interest in BHR. [ 38 ] However, as of April 2020, Chinese business records showed that Hunter Biden remained a board member of BHR. [ 39 ] According to his lawyer, Biden had "not received any compensation for being on BHR's board of directors" nor had he received any return on his equity share in BHR. [ 40 ] Biden's lawyer George Mesires told The Washington Post that BHR Partners had been "capitalized from various sources with a total of 30 million RMB ( Renminbi ), or about $4.2 million, not $1.5 billion". [ 32 ] Biden's solely-owned company Skaneateles LLC owned a 10% equity stake in BHR as of December 2020. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] In November 2021, New York Times reported that "Chinese corporate records show Skaneateles remains a part owner of BHR". [ 38 ] Skaneateles was dissolved in 2022. BHR Partners invests Chinese venture capital into tech startups, such as an early-stage investment in Chinese auto hailing app DiDi [ 33 ] and cross-border acquisitions in automotive and mining, for example, the purchase of a stake in Democratic Republic of Congo copper and cobalt producer Tenke Fungurume Mining . [ 43 ] [ 44 ] The New York Times reported that BHR Partners helped finance a coal-mining company in Australia that was controlled by a Chinese state-owned enterprise , assisted a subsidiary of a Chinese defense company in acquiring an auto parts manufacturer in Michigan, and facilitated the $3.8 billion purchase of the DRC cobalt mine. A former BHR board member told the Times that Biden and the other American BHR founder, Devon Archer , were not involved in the mine deal. [ 38 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Burisma Holdings See also: Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory and Trump–Ukraine scandal In April 2014, Biden joined the board of Burisma Holdings owned by Ukrainian oligarch and former politician Mykola Zlochevsky , who was facing a money laundering investigation just after the Ukrainian revolution . [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] Biden's business partner, Devon Archer, had joined the board of Burisma several months prior. Biden was hired to help Burisma with requesting assistance from the U.S government to expand its business and corporate governance best practices , while still an attorney with Boies Schiller Flexner . A consulting firm in which Biden is a partner was also retained by Burisma. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Christopher Heinz, John Kerry 's stepson, opposed his partners Devon Archer and Hunter Biden joining the board in 2014 due to the reputational risk . [ 48 ] Biden served on the board of Burisma until his term expired in April 2019, [ 52 ] receiving compensation of up to $50,000 per month. [ 52 ] [ 51 ] Because Joe Biden played a major role in U.S. policy towards Ukraine, some Ukrainian anti-corruption advocates [ 54 ] [ 55 ] and Obama administration officials expressed concern that Hunter Biden having joined the board could create the appearance of a conflict of interest and undermine Joe Biden's anti-corruption work in Ukraine. [ 2 ] [ 48 ] While serving as vice president, Joe Biden joined other Western leaders in encouraging the government of Ukraine to fire the country's top prosecutor Viktor Shokin , [ 56 ] [ 57 ] who was widely criticized for blocking corruption investigations. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] The Ukrainian parliament voted to remove Shokin in March 2016. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] Biden lobbied the U.S. State Department on behalf of Burisma to help secure a potentially lucrative energy project in Italy while his father was still Vice President. In 2016, Biden wrote a letter to the U.S. ambassador to Italy, John R. Phillips , which Biden's lawyer described as seeking to arrange an introduction between Burisma and the president of Italy's Tuscany region, the location of a potential Burisma energy project. A businessman involved in Burisma's project said that the outreach was undertaken at a time when Burisma was having difficulty securing regulatory approval for its Tuscany project. Embassy officials who handled the letter were concerned about the son of the sitting vice president reaching out on behalf of a foreign company, and Biden's request for a meeting was ultimately unmet. As President, Joe Biden released records confirming Hunter Biden's lobbying effort after dropping out of his 2024 presidential campaign , and denied being aware of it while vice president. [ 50 ] [ 62 ] Since early 2019, Hunter and his father Joe Biden have been the subjects of false and baseless claims of corrupt activities in a Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory pushed by then-U.S. president Donald Trump and his allies. [ 63 ] Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani claimed in 2019, without evidence, that Joe Biden had sought the dismissal of Shokin in order to protect his son and Burisma Holdings. Actually, it was the official policy of the United States and the European Union to seek Shokin's removal. [ 64 ] [ 54 ] [ 56 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] There has also been no evidence produced of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden in Ukraine. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] The Ukrainian anti-corruption investigation agency stated in September 2019 that its current investigation of Burisma was restricted solely to investigating the period from 2010 to 2012, before Hunter Biden joined Burisma in 2014. [ 69 ] Shokin, in May 2019, claimed that he was fired because he had been actively investigating Burisma, [ 70 ] but U.S. and Ukrainian officials have stated that the investigation into Burisma was dormant at the time of Shokin's dismissal. [ 48 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ] Ukrainian and United States State Department sources note that Shokin was fired for failing to address corruption, including within his office. [ 65 ] [ 55 ] [ 72 ] In July 2019, Trump ordered the freezing of $391 million in military aid [ 73 ] shortly before a telephone conversation with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy in which Trump asked Zelenskyy to initiate an investigation of the Bidens. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] Trump falsely told Zelenskyy that "[Joe] Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution" of his son; Joe Biden did not stop any prosecution, did not brag about doing so, and there is no evidence his son was ever under investigation. [ 76 ] The United States House of Representatives initiated a formal impeachment inquiry on September 24, 2019, against Trump on the grounds that he may have sought to use U.S. foreign aid and the Ukrainian government to damage Joe Biden's 2020 presidential campaign . [ 77 ] Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko said in May 2019 that Hunter Biden had not violated Ukrainian law. After Lutsenko was replaced by Ruslan Riaboshapka as prosecutor general, Lutsenko and Riaboshapka said in September and October 2019 respectively that they had seen no evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. [ 56 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ] During 2019 and 2020, Republican senators Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley investigated Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma, as well as allegations that Democrats colluded with the Ukrainian government to interfere in the 2016 election. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee Republican senator Richard Burr privately expressed concerns to the senators that their inquiries could assist efforts by Russian intelligence to spread disinformation to disrupt American domestic affairs. [ 80 ] American intelligence officials briefed senators in late 2019 about Russian efforts to frame Ukraine for 2016 election interference. [ 81 ] Johnson said he would release findings in spring 2020, as Democrats would be selecting their 2020 presidential nominee, but instead ramped up the investigation at Trump's urging in May 2020, after it became clear that Joe Biden would be the nominee. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] Trump tweeted a press report about the investigations, later stating that he would make allegations of corruption by the Bidens a central theme of his re-election campaign. [ 81 ] Johnson decided in March 2020 against issuing a subpoena for former Ukrainian official Andrii Telizhenko, a Giuliani associate who had made appearances on the pro-Trump cable channel One America News , after the FBI briefed him about concerns Telizhenko could be spreading Russian disinformation. [ 84 ] The State Department revoked Telizhenko's visa in October 2020, and CNN reported the American government was considering sanctioning him as a Russian agent. [ 85 ] CNN reported that Vladislav Davidzon, the editor of Ukrainian magazine The Odessa Review , told CNN that in 2018 Telizhenko offered him money to lobby Republican senators in support of pro-Russian television stations in Ukraine. [ 86 ] When Johnson released the final report on the investigation, it contained no evidence that Joe Biden had pushed for Shokin's removal in order to benefit Hunter or Burisma. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] In June 2020, former Ukrainian prosecutor general Ruslan Riaboshapka stated that an audit of thousands of old case files he had ordered in October 2019 had found no wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. Riaboshapka was described by Zelenskyy as "100 percent my person" during the July 2019 call in which Trump asked him to investigate Biden. [ 89 ] Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Derkach , an associate of Rudy Giuliani with links to Russian intelligence, released in May 2020 alleged snippets of recordings of Joe Biden speaking with Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko during the years Hunter Biden worked for Burisma. [ 90 ] The recordings, which were not verified as authentic and appeared heavily edited, depicted Biden linking loan guarantees for Ukraine to the ouster of the country's prosecutor general. The recordings did not provide evidence to support the ongoing conspiracy theory that Biden wanted the prosecutor fired to protect his son. [ 91 ] Poroshenko denied in June 2020 that Joe Biden ever approached him about Burisma. [ 92 ] [ 93 ] The United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Derkach in September 2020, stating he "has been an active Russian agent for over a decade, maintaining close connections with the Russian Intelligence Services". The Treasury Department added Derkach "waged a covert influence campaign centered on cultivating false and unsubstantiated narratives concerning U.S. officials in the upcoming 2020 Presidential Election" including by the release of "edited audio tapes and other unsupported information with the intent to discredit U.S. officials". [ 94 ] [ 95 ] Close associates of Derkach were also sanctioned by the Treasury Department in January 2021. [ 96 ] United States intelligence community analysis released in March 2021 found that Derkach was among proxies of Russian intelligence who promoted and laundered misleading or unsubstantiated narratives about Biden "to US media organizations, US officials, and prominent US individuals, including some close to former President Trump and his administration". [ 97 ] [ 98 ] Two Republicans on a Senate investigation committee in 2020 claimed that Russian businessperson Yelena Baturina , the wife of former Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov , wire-transferred $3.5 million in 2014 to Rosemont Seneca Thornton, of which Biden had previously been a partner. The Washington Post reported in April 2022 that the partners of Rosemont Seneca Thornton had agreed to dissolve the organization before the 2014 wire transfer, though it continued to be operated by Devin Archer to facilitate real estate transactions for eastern and central Asia investors, while Biden was uninvolved. Archer received the $3.5 million wire from Baturina to purchase property in Brooklyn, New York . [ 22 ] The Senate report cited unspecified confidential documents and gave no evidence that Biden personally accepted the funds. [ 99 ] Biden's attorney denied the report, saying Biden had no financial relationship with Baturina and no stake in the partnership that received the money, nor did he co-found the partnership. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] However, Trump's White House spokeswoman Alyssa Farah repeated the claim, and in a press conference Trump repeatedly asserted that Biden received millions of dollars from the former mayor's wife. [ 99 ] Investigations and federal indictments Main article: Weiss special counsel investigation In December 2020, Biden made a public announcement via his attorney that his tax affairs were under federal criminal investigation. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] The New York Times and CNN described the investigation as having started in late 2018 and being related to potential violations of tax and money laundering laws and Biden's business dealings in foreign countries, principally China. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] The Wall Street Journal reported that Biden had provided legal and consulting services that generated foreign-earned income, citing a Senate Republicans' report that $4.79 million in wire transfers from entities linked to Chinese energy tycoon Ye Jianming and his company, CEFC China Energy , were paying for such services. [ 104 ] The New York Times reported that FBI investigators had been unable to establish sufficient evidence for a prosecution of potential money laundering crimes, including after the seizure of a laptop belonging to Biden, and so the investigation progressed onto tax issues. [ 105 ] [ 106 ] Since October 2021, Hollywood attorney and writer Kevin Morris , who has become an influential adviser/confidant and now financier to Biden, lent Biden more than $6.5 million to pay back taxes, support his family, and fund legal expenses. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] The New York Times reported in March 2022 that, since 2018, Biden and possibly others had been under investigation by federal prosecutors in Delaware, with a grand jury convened to subpoena and hear evidence. The investigation examined payments and gifts Biden or his associates had received from foreign interests and whether Biden had violated the law by not registering as a lobbyist under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). The Times reported it had acquired emails that were authenticated by people familiar with them and the investigation that appeared to come from a laptop belonging to Biden. One April 2014 email, written by Biden to his business partner as their work with Burisma was about to begin, noted that his father, then the vice president who would soon visit Kyiv , should "be characterized as part of our advice and thinking—but what he will say and do is out of our hands". The email also stated that Burisma officials "need to know in no uncertain terms that we will not and cannot intervene directly with domestic policymakers, and that we need to abide by FARA and any other U.S. laws in the strictest sense across the board". Biden wrote that his father's visit "could be a really good thing or it could end up creating too great an expectation. We need to temper expectations regarding that visit." He also wrote that his employer, the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, could help Burisma through "direct discussions at state , energy and NSC [ United States National Security Council ]". Other emails showed Biden and his business partner discussing inviting foreign business associates, including a Burisma executive, to attend an April 2015 dinner in Washington, where the vice president would stop by. [ 109 ] A July 2022 report from CNN authenticated emails which showed that Biden was struggling with large debt and overdue tax bills. [ 110 ] [ 111 ] In October 2022, The Washington Post reported that federal agents had determined months prior that they had assembled enough evidence for a viable criminal case against Biden to charge him with crimes related to making false declarations during a gun purchase, as well as tax-related crimes. The next step was for Delaware U.S. attorney David C. Weiss , a holdover from the Trump administration, [ 112 ] to decide on whether to file such charges. [ 113 ] Federal investigators had also been examining the lobbying firm Blue Star Strategies, which Burisma retained while Biden sat on its board, for possible illegal lobbying of American officials. There was no indication Biden was a subject of the investigation. Blue Star employees said in Senate testimony that Biden was included in emails about the firm's work but that he was not particularly involved. One of the firm's co-founders said Biden did not direct its work. Blue Star's work came after Burisma's owner was criticized by the United States State Department, and the firm's founders testified the firm had merely approached officials to determine the government's views of Burisma. [ 114 ] [ 115 ] On June 20, 2023, in a deal with prosecutors, Biden agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges of failure to pay income tax, and to enter a pretrial diversion program related to a felony gun charge of unlawful possession of a firearm. [ 116 ] [ 117 ] [ 118 ] Prosecutors recommended two years of probation for the tax charges; the gun charge would be dropped at the end of this period if the conditions of the diversion program had been met successfully. [ 112 ] Having the gun charge dropped was conditional on Biden remaining drug-free and never being allowed to own a firearm again. [ 119 ] Biden's attorney said the agreement with prosecutors "resolved" the investigation, though the Justice Department said the investigation was "ongoing". In court on July 26, 2023, federal prosecutors explained that the "ongoing" aspect of the investigation referred to possible charges under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA); FARA requires that anyone who acts on the behalf of a foreign government, e.g. China or Ukraine, must register with the Department of Justice and file regular reports on their activities for that government. [ 120 ] On July 26, the plea deal was rejected by the presiding judge, who cited concerns over immunity Biden might receive from future charges, and gave 30 days to both the government prosecutors and Biden's defense team to provide additional information. [ 119 ] Biden changed his plea from "guilty" to "not guilty". [ 121 ] [ 122 ] On August 8, Weiss requested appointment as a special counsel in the Biden investigation, which attorney general Merrick Garland granted. Garland announced the appointment on August 11, the same day Weiss announced government and Biden attorneys could not reach agreement on a new plea deal. [ 123 ] [ 124 ] The Justice Department said on September 6 that Weiss would ask a grand jury to return an indictment of Biden on a gun charge by September 29. [ 125 ] On September 14, Biden was officially indicted in Delaware on three federal firearms-related charges: two for making false statements on a firearm application form and one for prohibited possession of a firearm. [ 126 ] He was arraigned on October 3 and pleaded not guilty to all charges. [ 127 ] Legal experts noted that prosecutions for these charges are rare. [ 128 ] [ 129 ] In January 2024, prosecutors urged a judge to not dismiss Biden's gun charge, revealing that cocaine residue was found in his gun pouch. [ 130 ] On December 7, 2023, Biden was indicted in California on nine tax charges, including three felony and six misdemeanor offenses. The indictment reads that "The Defendant engaged in a four-year scheme to not pay at least $1.4 million in self-assessed federal taxes he owed for tax years 2016 through 2019." Biden's lawyer said that Biden had repaid his taxes in full prior to the indictment. [ 131 ] [ 132 ] On January 11, 2024, Biden pleaded not guilty to the tax charges. [ 133 ] [ 134 ] The same day, U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi scheduled the trial for June 20, 2024. [ 135 ] [ 134 ] The trial was later delayed to September 5, 2024, due to the "needs of the defendant" in preparing for his Delaware trial on firearms charges in June. [ 136 ] Biden repeatedly sought to dismiss both tax and gun charges against him, without success. [ 137 ] [ 138 ] In August 2024, prosecutors alleged that Biden agreed to lobby on behalf of a Romanian businessman seeking to "influence U.S. government agencies" while his father was vice president. The businessman, Gabriel Popoviciu, was under criminal investigation in Romania at the time and hired Biden to assist in fighting his criminal charges through the US government. Prosecutors sought to introduce evidence from Biden's work with Popoviciu as part of his charges on tax evasion. [ 139 ] [ 140 ] A pre-trial hearing for the tax indictment which involved Biden's lawyers would be held on August 21, 2024. [ 141 ] Firearms trial and convictions A final pre-trial hearing for the gun charges was held on May 24, 2024. [ 142 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ] During the final hearing, Judge Maryellen Noreika ruled that prosecutors could not refer to his upcoming California tax trial, child support proceedings in Arkansas, his discharge from the Navy, or include statements which Biden made at a July 2023 hearing where his plea deal collapsed. [ 143 ] However, the prosecution was permitted to bring up Biden's drug use, portions of his memoir, and a summary of data from his laptop, phone, and iPad . [ 143 ] [ 145 ] Biden's trial began on June 3, 2024, on charges of unlawfully possessing a gun as a drug user, lying on a federal form when he bought the gun, and making a false statement about information required to be collected by a federally licensed gun dealer. The charges stemmed from a gun purchased and possessed by Biden in October 2018. During the trial, three of Biden's former partners testified regarding Biden's drug usage and gun purchase. [ 145 ] On June 11, Biden was found guilty on three felony charges for federal gun violations. [ 146 ] [ 147 ] The conviction made Biden the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be convicted in a criminal trial. [ 148 ] Due to his conviction on felony charges, Biden's license to practice law in Washington, D.C. was suspended. [ 149 ] Biden was scheduled to be sentenced on December 12, 2024, which did not occur due to him being pardoned by his father on December 1. [ 150 ] Tax indictment and guilty pleas On September 5, 2024, Biden's defense lawyer Abbe Lowell revealed that Biden would change his plea from not guilty to guilty in the federal tax case. [ 151 ] Biden had been indicted with three felony charges– one tax evasion count and two counts of filing false returns – and six misdemeanor charges. [ 152 ] It was not immediately clear if the presiding Judge Mark C. Scarsi would accept this plea proposal, which would be regarded as an Alford plea . [ 153 ] Under this proposed plea agreement, Biden would have accepted both a sentence and the strength of evidence against him, but also maintained his innocence. [ 154 ] [ 153 ] Later in the day, it was reported that this plea offer would not be accepted by the prosecution. [ 155 ] Initially, Judge Scarsi would neither accept the initial plea offer or call off the trial, but also did not make a final ruling and would opt to make a decision about the plea offer at a later time. [ 154 ] [ 156 ] Prosecutors said they would reject an Alford plea. [ 157 ] However, Scarsi would accept a guilty plea by the end of the day, with Biden pleading guilty to all nine charges. [ 158 ] During his plea hearing, Biden responded "Yes" after Scarsi asked him "Do you agree you committed every element of the charges in the indictment?" [ 158 ] Biden was scheduled to be sentenced on December 16, 2024 and he could have faced up to 17 years in prison. Former federal prosecutor, Tom Dupree, told CBS News he expected the judge to impose a sentence of fewer than five years. President Biden, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, First Lady Jill Biden, and White House spokesperson Andrew Bates repeatedly stated that the president would decline to pardon Hunter or commute his sentence. [ 158 ] [ 150 ] Pardon of criminal offenses Pardon dated December 1, 2024 On December 1, 2024, President Biden issued a full and unconditional pardon for his son. The pardon covered all federal offenses committed between January 1, 2014, and December 1, 2024, and included his tax charges, gun charges, and any other potential charges within that time. In an official White House statement from President Biden, he said that he believed his son was "selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted", and blamed political pressure for the failure of a plea deal for Hunter. [ 159 ] [ 160 ] He concluded by saying "I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision." The New York Times reported that the plea deal fell apart due to the presiding judge questioning its unusual construction, which violated a basic tenet of federal guilty pleas against having side deals in the plea agreement. [ 161 ] In court filings subsequent to the pardon, special counsel Weiss stated "there was none and never has been any evidence of vindictive or selective prosecution in this case". [ 162 ] Judge Scarsi stated that President Biden's characterizations "stand in tension with the case record" and that the Constitution does not "give the president the authority to rewrite history[.]" [ 163 ] The scope of the pardon was unusually broad and legal experts could recall only Richard Nixon as someone given similar terms for a pardon , for a term between 1969 and 1974. [ 164 ] [ 165 ] [ 150 ] The breadth of the pardon includes Hunter Biden's "entire tenure on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, as well as much of his other international work, including in China." [ 166 ] The pardon received bipartisan criticism from members of Congress as harming the justice system. [ 167 ] [ 168 ] In the months leading up to Hunter's scheduled sentencing, the President had made repeated statements that he would not use the pardon authority for his own son. He and his staff continued to state that there would be no pardon for Hunter as late as November, although internal staff discussions affirmed that the option for a pardon would remain on the table even as Biden publicly stated otherwise. [ 169 ] [ 150 ] Hunter issued the following statement in response to the pardon: I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction – mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport, I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering. [ 170 ] Laptop files Main article: Hunter Biden laptop controversy Hunter with his sister Ashley , at their father's inauguration, January 2021. Discovery of Hunter Biden's laptop was an October surprise prior to the 2020 election. [ 171 ] On October 14, 2020, twenty days prior to the 2020 United States presidential election , the New York Post published an article based on content provided to the publication by Donald Trump 's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and former chief strategist Steve Bannon . The article concerned what the Post said was a laptop computer that had belonged to Hunter Biden and that was allegedly left for repairs at a Wilmington, Delaware , computer shop. According to the narrative in the Post article, this device contained an email that referenced a "meeting" between Joe Biden and Vadym Pozharskyi, a Burisma advisor. [ 172 ] The article's veracity was strongly questioned at the time by many mainstream media outlets as well as dozens of current and former intelligence officials for possibly being a Russian disinformation campaign. [ 173 ] [ 174 ] (As of March 25, 2022, Vox reported that there was no evidence to corroborate the intelligence officials' suspicions that the laptop leak was part of a "Russian plot". [ 171 ] ) In January 2024, federal prosecutors stated that they had possession of a laptop computer which Hunter Biden left at the computer store and confirmed that the device contained files also found in cloud backups to Biden's Apple account. [ 175 ] In June 2024, the laptop and its contents were utilized as evidence during a federal court trial of Hunter Biden for firearms charges. FBI investigators testified at the trial, confirming the authenticity of the laptop, and stating that they had cross-referencing texts, emails, and messages found on the laptop with Apple and had verified the serial number on the laptop. Prosecutors also introduced the invoice from the repair shop as evidence. [ 176 ] [ 177 ] Biden was deposed by the House Judiciary and Oversight committees on February 28, 2024, which discussed emails found on the laptop. Biden stated during the deposition that he did not recall sending the laptop for repairs. [ 178 ] [ 179 ] In February 2023, Hunter Biden's attorneys wrote to the Justice Department National Security Division asking that they criminally investigate "individuals for whom there is considerable reason to believe violated various federal laws in accessing, copying, manipulating, and/or disseminating Mr. Biden's personal computer data". A similar letter was sent to the Attorney General of Delaware . The letters named Giuliani, Bannon, Mac Isaac (owner of the Wilmington computer repair shop where the laptop was abandoned), and others. [ 180 ] [ 181 ] The special counsel assigned to the case later described Hunter Biden's claim of right-wing bias as "fiction designed for a Hollywood script". [ 175 ] Another event resulting from discovery of the laptop occurred in January 2023: an anonymous Twitter account posted a rental application found on the laptop, leading to a false claim that in 2018 Hunter Biden had paid rent while residing at his father's Delaware home, where classified documents had been found . James Comer , chair of the House Oversight Committee that was investigating the Biden family , inquired whether it was evidence that Hunter Biden illicitly provided money from his foreign business activities to his father. The document was determined to be a quarterly rental payment for office space at the House of Sweden in Washington, D.C. [ 182 ] Navy Reserve Biden's application for a position in the U.S. Navy Reserve was approved in May 2013. [ 183 ] At age 43, Biden was accepted as part of a program that allows a limited number of applicants with desirable skills to receive commissions and serve in staff positions. [ 184 ] Biden received an age-related waiver and a waiver for a past drug-related incident; he was sworn in as a direct commission officer by his father in a White House ceremony. [ 183 ] [ 2 ] Results of a routine urinalysis taken on Biden's first weekend of reserve duty revealed cocaine in his system. [ 2 ] [ 184 ] He was discharged administratively in February 2014. [ 184 ] [ 185 ] Biden attributed the result to having smoked a cigarette that he had asked a group of men outside a store to give him, claiming the cigarette contained cocaine as well as tobacco. [ 2 ] He did not appeal the discharge, stating that he thought it unlikely the panel would believe his explanation given his history of drug addiction. [ 186 ] [ 2 ] Biden also stated that he did not appeal due to the likelihood that this would result in the press becoming aware of the discharge; however, it was eventually disclosed to The Wall Street Journal by a Navy official. [ 2 ] [ 183 ] Work as an artist In February 2020, The New York Times reported that Biden had been painting as an "undiscovered artist" in his Hollywood Hills home. The report also displayed some of his paintings, including "Untitled #4 (a study in ink)" and "Untitled #3 (a signed work)". [ 187 ] Biden's art dealer, Georges Bergès, hosted a private viewing for Biden in Los Angeles in fall 2021, followed by an exhibition in New York. [ 188 ] Biden's paintings were put up for sale for as much as $500,000 per painting, with Kevin Morris purchasing $875,000 worth of his art. [ 189 ] Another buyer was Elizabeth Hirsh Naftali, a prominent California Democratic Party donor who was appointed to the U.S. Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad by Joe Biden. Business Insider was unable to verify how much Hirsh Naftali spent on the art, nor whether the purchase occurred before or after her appointment. An ethicist interviewed by the news website said that the purchase was ethically problematic, particularly if it occurred before her appointment, as "it might be perceived as a quid pro quo ." [ 190 ] The purchases provoked concerns about possible conflicts of interest and a lack of transparency. [ 191 ] [ 192 ] According to court filings by Biden, between December 2021 and December 2023, he sold approximately $1.5 million of his art. [ 193 ] From December 2023 to March 2025, he sold $36,000 of art. [ 193 ] Presidency of Joe Biden During his father's presidency, Hunter emerged as one of six key individuals who insulated Joe from scrutiny and acted as an intermediary between him and others. [ 194 ] After a poor presidential debate performance by Joe in June 2024 caused intensified public concern about his age and fitness for the presidency, Hunter helped Joe with speech preparation and began joining meetings with the president and his staffers. [ 195 ] Hunter maintained daily, often hourly contact with his father on calls. Joe increasingly relied on Hunter for advice, and Hunter emerged as one of the strongest voices in Joe's circle urging him not to drop out of his reelection campaign . [ 196 ] [ 197 ] [ 198 ] [ 199 ] Hunter had been a regular presence in public White House events, but his increased involvement in Biden's presidency and campaign led to surprise and concern from White House staffers. After Joe's poor debate performance, Hunter advocated for Joe to fire some of his top staffers, including Anita Dunn and Bob Bauer . Hunter also began acting as a "de facto gatekeeper" for access to the president. [ 197 ] [ 199 ] [ 200 ] Litigation Between 2023 and 2024, Hunter privately sued numerous individuals, organizations, and the U.S. Government alleging various instances of invasion of privacy and defamation. In September 2023, Biden filed suit against the IRS , claiming unlawful disclosures of his tax return information in relation to two IRS employees who provided information to members of Congress. [ 201 ] The D.C. District Court dismissed his claim under the Privacy Act in September 2024, and Biden dropped the suit altogether in 2025. [ 202 ] In 2023, Biden sued Garrett Ziegler 's Marco Polo organization, accusing the group of invasion of privacy for publishing 128,000 of his emails that were recovered from his lost laptop computer. [ 203 ] In March 2025, Biden sought to have the case dismissed due to his worsening personal financial situation and inability to continue to pay for his own legal representation. [ 203 ] In 2024, Biden sued Rudy Giuliani alleging Giuliani was responsible for the "total annihilation" of his privacy due to his involvement in releasing data from his laptop computer. [ 204 ] He dropped the lawsuit shortly thereafter. [ 204 ] The same year, he sued Fox News for airing images taken from the laptop, but dropped the lawsuit without explanation the following month. [ 205 ] Three months later, however, he resurrected the lawsuit in state court. [ 206 ] In a statement, Fox News described the second lawsuit as "devoid of any merit". [ 206 ] Later life Following the presidency of Joe Biden, according to The Daily Beast , Hunter fell "on hard times". [ 207 ] The prior year — in 2024 — his law license had been suspended, NBC News noting at the time that it was unclear what impact the suspension would have on his livelihood. [ 208 ] In January 2025, his rental home was damaged and left uninhabitable during the Palisades Fire and he had difficulty finding new housing, resulting in him experiencing homelessness. By this point, he was several million dollars in debt and his income severely impacted by flagging interest in his memoir, which was selling less than 200 copies per month. In court filings, Biden averred that he had anticipated earning money from invitations for paid speaking engagements, but no such invitations had materialized. [ 207 ] [ 209 ] In March 2025, Hunter's Secret Service detail was withdrawn on the direction of Donald Trump. Prior to the end of his term, Joe Biden had ordered an extended period of post-presidency protection for Hunter. [ 210 ] Personal life Relationships Biden (center) with family at his brother Beau's funeral in June 2015 In 1993, Biden married Kathleen Buhle . [ 2 ] They have three daughters: Naomi (named after Biden's sister), [ 211 ] Finnegan, and Maisey. [ 10 ] The couple formally separated in October 2015, and divorced in 2017. [ 212 ] [ 213 ] Buhle's 2022 memoir If We Break documents her account of the relationship. [ 214 ] Biden began a relationship with his brother's widow Hallie Olivere Biden in 2016. [ 215 ] [ 2 ] The relationship ended in 2019. [ 2 ] [ 216 ] [ 217 ] Between 2017 and 2018, Biden also had a romantic relationship with Zoë Kestan . [ 217 ] Biden has a fourth daughter, born in August 2018 in Arkansas , to Lunden Alexis Roberts. [ 218 ] [ 219 ] Biden initially denied that the child was his, but a DNA test , conducted as part of a paternity suit filed in May 2019 by Roberts, confirmed he is the father. The lawsuit was settled in March 2020 after Biden agreed to pay Roberts $20,000 a month in child support. [ 220 ] [ 221 ] Biden filed a motion in September 2022 to reduce his child support payments, on the basis of reduced income; Roberts opposed this request and also petitioned the Arkansas court to change the child's surname to Biden, so that his daughter might benefit from associations with Biden's family. [ 222 ] In June 2023, Biden and Roberts settled the dispute. As part of the settlement, Biden agreed to give several of his paintings to his daughter and pay an undisclosed monthly amount in child support until the daughter turns 18. Biden also agreed to assist with college tuition. Roberts agreed to drop her petition to change their daughter's surname. [ 223 ] [ 224 ] [ 225 ] The matter received significant attention in the media. [ 226 ] Biden married South African filmmaker Melissa Cohen in May 2019, within a week of first meeting her. [ 186 ] [ 227 ] Their son, named Beau in honor of Biden's brother, was born in March 2020 in Los Angeles. [ 228 ] [ 229 ] Drug and alcohol abuse Biden has abused drugs and alcohol throughout his adult life, which he has detailed in his 2021 memoir. [ 230 ] [ 231 ] He believes his addiction issues are linked to episodes of family loss he suffered, [ 232 ] beginning with the 1972 motor vehicle accident that killed his mother and sister. [ 233 ] Biden said that his family never talked much with him about the accident, and this allowed the emotional trauma he felt to remain unresolved; it worsened following the death of his brother, Beau. [ 232 ] Over the past two decades, Biden has been in multiple substance abuse rehabilitation programs , each followed by an interval of sobriety followed by relapse. At his worst, Biden stated that he was "smoking crack every 15 minutes". [ 234 ] The $11 million Biden and his firm were paid from 2013 to 2018 fueled his addiction. In his memoir, he wrote that the money "turned into a major enabler during my steepest skid into addiction" and "hounded me to spend recklessly, dangerously, destructively. Humiliatingly. So I did." [ 24 ] He had an intervention in early 2019. [ 235 ] Memoir Biden released Beautiful Things , a memoir of the trauma of the accident that claimed his mother and sister, and his later addiction struggles, on April 6, 2021. [ 236 ] The New York Times described the book as "equal parts family saga, grief narrative and addict's howl". [ 237 ] References ^ Phelps, Jordyn; Saenz, Arlette (August 25, 2015).
