Revenue Procedure 2024-40 PDF provides detailed information on adjustments and changes to more than 60 tax provisions that will impact taxpayers when they file their returns in 2026. Notable changes for tax year 2025 The tax year 2025 adjustments described below generally apply to income tax returns to be filed starting tax season 2026. The tax items for tax year 2025 of greatest interest to many taxpayers include the following dollar amounts: Standard deductions. For single taxpayers and married individuals filing separately for tax year 2025, the standard deduction rises to $15,000 for 2025, an increase of $400 from 2024. For married couples filing jointly, the standard deduction rises to $30,000, an increase of $800 from tax year 2024. For heads of households, the standard deduction will be $22,500 for tax year 2025, an increase of $600 from the amount for tax year 2024. Marginal rates. For tax year 2025, the top tax rate remains 37% for individual single taxpayers with incomes greater than $626,350 ($751,600 for married couples filing jointly). The other rates are: 35% for incomes over $250,525 ($501,050 for married couples filing jointly). 32% for incomes over $197,300 ($394,600 for married couples filing jointly). 24% for incomes over $103,350 ($206,700 for married couples filing jointly). 22% for incomes over $48,475 ($96,950 for married couples filing jointly). 12% for incomes over $11,925 ($23,850 for married couples filing jointly). 10% for incomes $11,925 or less ($23,850 or less for married couples filing jointly). Alternative minimum tax exemption amounts. For tax year 2025, the exemption amount for unmarried individuals increases to $88,100 ($68,650 for married individuals filing separately) and begins to phase out at $626,350. For married couples filing jointly, the exemption amount increases to $137,000 and begins to phase out at $1,252,700. Earned income tax credits. For qualifying taxpayers who have three or more qualifying children, the tax year 2025 maximum Earned Income Tax Credit amount is $8,046, an increase from $7,830 for tax year 2024. The revenue procedure contains a table providing maximum EITC amount for other categories, income thresholds and phase-outs. Qualified transportation fringe benefit. For tax year 2025, the monthly limitation for the qualified transportation fringe benefit and the monthly limitation for qualified parking rises to $325, increasing from $315 in tax year 2024. Health flexible spending cafeteria plans. For the taxable years beginning in 2025, the dollar limitation for employee salary reductions for contributions to health flexible spending arrangements rises to $3,300, increasing from $3,200 in tax year 2024. For cafeteria plans that permit the carryover of unused amounts, the maximum carryover amount rises to $660, increasing from $640 in tax year 2024. Medical savings accounts . For tax year 2025, participants who have self-only coverage the plan must have an annual deductible that is not less than $2,850 (a $50 increase from the previous tax year), but not more than $4,300 (an increase of $150 from the previous tax year). The maximum out-of-pocket expense amount rises to $5,700, increasing from $5,550 in tax year 2024. For family coverage in tax year 2025, the annual deductible is not less than $5,700, increasing from $5,550 in tax year 2024; however, the deductible cannot be more than $8,550, an increase of $200 versus the limit for tax year 2024. For family coverage, the out-of-pocket expense limit is $10,500 for tax year 2025, rising from $10,200 in tax year 2024. Foreign earned income exclusion. For tax year 2025, the foreign earned income exclusion increases to $130,000, from $126,500 in tax year 2024. Estate tax credits. Estates of decedents who die during 2025 have a basic exclusion amount of $13,990,000, increased from $13,610,000 for estates of decedents who died in 2024. Annual exclusion for gifts increases to $19,000 for calendar year 2025, rising from $18,000 for calendar year 2024. Adoption credits. For tax year 2025, the maximum credit allowed for an adoption of a child with special needs is the amount of qualified adoption expenses up to $17,280, increased from $16,810 for tax year 2024. Unchanged for tax year 2025 By statute, certain items that were indexed for inflation in the past are currently not adjusted. Personal exemptions for tax year 2025 remain at 0, as in tax year 2024. The elimination of the personal exemption was a provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Itemized deductions. There is no limitation on itemized deductions for tax year 2025, as in tax year 2024 and preceding, to tax year 2018. The limitation on itemized deductions was eliminated by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Lifetime learning credits. The modified adjusted gross income amount used by taxpayers to determine the reduction in the Lifetime Learning Credit provided in Sec. 25A(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code is not adjusted for inflation for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2020. The Lifetime Learning Credit is phased out for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income in excess of $80,000 ($160,000 for joint returns).

Revenue Procedure 2023-34 provides detailed information about these annual adjustments. New for 2024 Starting in calendar year 2023, the Inflation Reduction Act reinstates the Hazardous Substance Superfund financing rate for crude oil received at U.S. refineries, and petroleum products that entered into the United States for consumption, use, or warehousing.

For calendar years beginning in 2024, the Hazardous Substance Superfund financing rate is adjusted for inflation. For calendar year 2024 crude oil or petroleum products entered after Dec. 31, 2016, will have a tax rate of $0.26 cents a barrel.

The Alternative Minimum Tax exemption amount for tax year 2024 is $85,700 and begins to phase out at $609,350 ($133,300 for married couples filing jointly for whom the exemption begins to phase out at $1,218,700). For comparison, the 2023 exemption amount was $81,300 and began to phase out at $578,150 ($126,500 for married couples filing jointly for whom the exemption began to phase out at $1,156,300). The tax year 2024 maximum Earned Income Tax Credit amount is $7,830 for qualifying taxpayers who have three or more qualifying children, an increase of from $7,430 for tax year 2023. The revenue procedure contains a table providing maximum EITC amount for other categories, income thresholds and phase-outs. For tax year 2024, the monthly limitation for the qualified transportation fringe benefit and the monthly limitation for qualified parking increases to $315, an increase of $15 from the limit for 2023. For the taxable years beginning in 2024, the dollar limitation for employee salary reductions for contributions to health flexible spending arrangements increases to $3,200. For cafeteria plans that permit the carryover of unused amounts, the maximum carryover amount is $640, an increase of $30 from taxable years beginning in 2023. For tax year 2024, participants who have self-only coverage in a Medical Savings Account, the plan must have an annual deductible that is not less than $2,800, an increase of $150 from tax year 2023, but not more than $4,150, an increase of $200 from tax year 2023. For self-only coverage, the maximum out-of-pocket expense amount is $5,550, an increase of $250 from 2023. For tax year 2024, for family coverage, the annual deductible is not less than $5,550, an increase of $200 from tax year 2023; however, the deductible cannot be more than $8,350, an increase of $450 versus the limit for tax year 2023.

Items unaffected by indexing By statute, certain items that were indexed for inflation in the past are currently not adjusted.

For 2024, as in 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018, there is no limitation on itemized deductions, as that limitation was eliminated by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The modified adjusted gross income amount used by taxpayers to determine the reduction in the Lifetime Learning Credit provided in § 25A(d)(2) is not adjusted for inflation for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2020.

February 20, 2025 Key provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 are set to expire Dec. 31, 2025. With a Republican-led White House and Congress, policymakers are projected to preserve a majority of the TCJA provisions, but they will need to find a source of funding for the extensions. The debate over tax policy, the federal budget, and the federal deficit is ongoing. Government affairs professionals with interests on either side of the debate need to track tax policy developments as they happen. Staying ahead of policy developments is one of the most critical tasks when planning a successful lobbying and public affairs strategy , especially when it comes to a policy area poised for change, like tax. [Download our report, Tracking and Influencing Tax Policy in 2025 , for tips and best practices to better monitor, respond to, and influence critical tax policy changes with confidence and precision.] What is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act? The TCJA, passed by a majority-Republican Congress in 2017, was the largest tax code overhaul in nearly three decades. The law cut the corporate tax rate to 21%, capped deductions for state and local taxes (SALT) at $10,000, doubled standard deductions, and expanded the child tax credit. The goal of the one and a half trillion-dollar tax reform bill was to spur economic growth, reduce regulations, and create a more business-friendly environment in the U.S. The TCJA was passed as reconciliation legislation, meaning the bill overrode typical filibuster rules and was passed by a Republican-led Senate with a simple majority of 51 votes. However, many provisions were made temporary to keep costs down and comply with the Byrd Rule, which prohibits reconciliation bills from raising the federal deficit beyond a 10-year budget window or making changes to Social Security. Does the 21% corporate tax rate expire? The TCJA cut the corporate tax rate to 21%, from 35%, which does not expire. Even though the corporate rate was made permanent, lawmakers are reopening the tax code to address all of the TCJA’s expiring provisions, so everything is on the table. While on the campaign trail, Trump has stated that he intends to reduce the corporate rate to 15% for companies that make their products in America. Republicans may have to swallow raising the rate back up a bit during the 2025 negotiations, as Congress will need to find ways to offset a loss of revenue from extending other pieces of the TCJA, especially those benefits for individual taxpayers. Which TCJA corporate tax provisions are set to expire? The potential expiration of the TCJA’s corporate tax provisions poses significant implications for U.S. businesses, including changes to the corporate tax rate, capital expensing, the pass-through income deduction, and international taxation. The following sections describe which provisions are set to expire in more depth. Pass-through income deduction Pass-through businesses – sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S-corporations – will no longer be able to deduct up to 20% of qualified business income (QBI) when calculating annual taxes. Republicans are more staunch supporters of the 199A deduction and claim that it levels the playing field for small and mid-sized business by reducing their tax burden in a similar way to how the TCJA’s corporate tax rate cut did for C-corporations. Industries that primarily benefit from the deduction, such as real estate and manufacturing, have revved up lobbying efforts on Capitol Hill to extend the tax break. Many groups are targeting moderate Democrats to create bipartisan support for the deduction’s extension. Business expense deductions Bonus depreciation The 100% bonus depreciation provision – allowing the deduction of certain capital investments – will be phased out by 2027. The 2025 bonus depreciation rate will be reduced to 40%. Research and development (R&D) The TCJA’s amortization requirement will remain in effect beyond 2025 unless Congress acts to repeal or modify it. The Wyden-Smith bill aims to restore immediate expensing for R&D costs and expand the R&D tax credit. Business interest deduction The business interest deduction will revert to pre-TCJA rules, which generally allowed business interest expenses to be deducted in the year the interest was paid or accrued, with some limitations. International tax provisions International tax policy has significantly changed since TCJA’s passage. Brokered by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a global agreement called Pillar 2, went into effect in 2024 in many countries and will continue to impact businesses worldwide. Pillar 2 aims to curb base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) by applying a 15% minimum tax rate for multinational enterprises (MNEs) with a global annual revenue of 750 million euros. The TCJA also attempts to address tax avoidance through measures such as the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) tax, the foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) tax, and the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT). However, the TCJA’s provisions and Pillar 2 clash on several key details. There is a safe harbor provision that shields U.S. companies from some of the harshest effects of Pillar 2. But given that the safe harbor provisions expires at the end of 2026, Congress will need to decide how to rectify the TCJA and Pillar 2 clash. [Are you a tax professional? See how Bloomberg Tax provides the tools and intelligence to guide your tax department through changes with ease.] Which TCJA individual tax provisions are set to expire? If Congress doesn’t renew or amend TCJA tax provisions, then individual filers will see a rise in their income tax rates, a lower standard deduction, changes to itemized deductions, and a rollback of the child tax credit. These changes could reshape the financial outlook for many Americans. See more details below. Individual tax rates When the TCJA expires at the end of 2025, marginal tax rates for individuals will revert to pre-TCJA levels, including a maximum rate of 39.6% from 37%. Generally, Democrats are hoping to raise the top rate back up, whereas Republicans support lowering marginal rates. Standard deductions The TCJA nearly doubled the standard deduction for both single and joint filers when it went into effect in 2018. Once the TCJA expires in 2025, the standard deduction will return to pre-TCJA levels, with an adjustment for inflation. Standard deductions before and after TCJA Mortgage interest and charitable donation deductions Once the TCJA expires, single and joint filers will be able to claim a mortgage interest deduction (MID) on properties up to $1 million in value. Between 2018 and 2025, the TCJA limited the MID to $750,000 in property value. Charitable contributions will revert to 50% from 60% of adjusted gross income (AGI). In general, itemized deductions will be more relevant with lower standard deductions. If the standard deduction goes back to a lower level, those making at least $400,000 would see diminishing value of the MID and charity deductions. SALT deductions The $10,000 SALT deduction cap will no longer apply. Since 2018, lawmakers from high-tax states, such as California, New Jersey, and New York, have tried and failed to get rid of or raise the cap, reporting that their constituents were disproportionately affected. Prior to the TCJA, there was no cap on SALT deductions. However, there were levers in place – such as the alternative minimum tax (AMT) – to ensure wealthy taxpayers couldn’t use deductions and loopholes to reduce their federal tax liability to zero. Estate and gift taxes Exemptions from estate and gift taxes will revert to pre-TCJA levels of around $5 million, adjusted for inflation. The 2024 exemption is $13.6 million. Republicans see the estate tax as a “death tax” that punishes wealth accumulation, as in the case of farmers who want to pass on their land through inheritance, but their estate ends up needing to sell assets to cover the estate taxes. Democrats, on the other hand, view the estate and gift taxes as a means to address inequities, where high income earners cannot pass on substantial fortunes or trusts without paying their fair share in taxes. Child tax credit The maximum child tax credit (CTC) will return to $1,000 per child, from the TCJA level of $2,000. Income thresholds will decrease to $75,000 for individuals and $110,000 for married couples. During the pandemic, the CTC was raised even further to $3,600. Census data showed that it cut childhood poverty in half, as a lot more families were eligible for the program. Although Democrats did not vote for the TCJA, party members back the expansion of the CTC. The bipartisan Wyden-Smith bill – which aims to raise the cap on CTC back to $2,000 – has languished in the Senate, though, due to opposition from Senate Republicans. On-demand webinar: Preparing for tax changes post-2025 Chris Cioffi and Danielle Parnass of Bloomberg Government and Kim Dixon of Bloomberg Tax discuss individual and corporate tax provisions that are on the table following TCJA’s expiration and how key decision-makers aim to extend or amend those areas of tax law. See the full replay on tax policy . [Are you a tax professional? See how Bloomberg Tax provides the tools and intelligence to guide your tax department through changes with ease.] Will the TCJA be extended? Partisan control of Congress will have a big impact on whether TCJA provisions will be renewed, reformed, or allowed to expire. Republicans are looking to extend the TCJA and further expand some tax cuts, while Democrats are focused on reforming tax breaks for lower- and middle-income households and raising taxes on wealthier individuals and corporations. There are several possible scenarios for tax policy proposals in 2025: Long-term extension If they control Congress following the 2024 election, Republican lawmakers are aiming to once again use the reconciliation process to extend the TCJA. Because reconciliation bills bypass the filibuster in the Senate and therefore don’t require 60 votes, it would be easier for GOP legislators to pass an extension of the TCJA – so long as there are no intra-party divisions that would affect the simple majority requirement. If Congress is divided, lawmakers could pass a bipartisan agreement that addresses expiring provisions in a long-term or permanent way. This happened in 2012 when a series of tax cuts enacted by George W. Bush were extended. Short-term extension Absent a full agreement, lawmakers could decide to extend the TCJA tax breaks by one or two years to give themselves more time for negotiations. This happened in 2010 when the government was divided after Democrats got “shellacked” in the midterms. Expiration If Congress fails to act, the TCJA’s provisions will expire and revert to pre-2017 levels. Although it is unlikely that all the provisions would expire, if this did happen, both corporate and individual taxpayers would experience a lot of uncertainty.

During the 2020 election campaign, he and his father were frequently accused by Donald Trump and his associates of wrongdoing in regards to China and Ukraine, allegations which they both denied. The New York Post reported on an alleged email in which an adviser from a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, apparently thanked Hunter for inviting him to meet his father, Joe Biden. Asked about the allegations, Joe Biden told a reporter it was a "smear campaign". No criminal activity has been proven, and no evidence has emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. In an interview with the BBC months after his father was sworn in as president, Hunter Biden defended his qualifications for the position at Burisma but added that, in retrospect, he had "missed... the perception that I would create". Claims of influence-peddling are common in Washington DC and Mr Trump's children have also been accused of conflicts of interest in lucrative business deals overseas. They, too, deny wrongdoing. What do we know about the federal investigation? The Justice Department is investigating Hunter Biden's finances including scrutinising some of his past Chinese business dealings and other transactions, a "person familiar with the matter" told The Associated Press in December . The tax investigation was launched in 2018 but Hunter Biden said he had learned about it for the first time in December 2020. Asked about the investigation by US broadcaster CBS this April, the president's son said: "I'm co-operating, completely. And I'm absolutely certain, 100% certain, that at the end of the investigation, that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing." What have the Bidens been accused of in China? The New York Post cited a purported email from Hunter Biden in August 2017 indicating he was receiving a $10m annual fee from a Chinese billionaire for "introductions alone", though it is unclear who was involved in the alleged introductions. Another purported email, which Fox News said it had confirmed, reportedly refers to a deal pursued by Hunter involving China's largest private energy firm. It is said to include a cryptic mention of "10 held by H for the big guy". Fox News cited unnamed sources as saying "the big guy" in the purported email was a reference to Joe Biden. This message is said to be from May 2017. Both emails would date from when the former US vice-president was a private citizen. A former business associate of Hunter Biden has come forward to say he can confirm the allegations. Tony Bobulinski told Fox News that, contrary to Joe Biden's statements that he had nothing to do with his son's business affairs, Hunter had "frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals" in China. Mr Bobulinski, who is reportedly a US Navy veteran, separately told Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he had met on two occasions with Joe Biden to discuss business deals with China, the first time in May 2017 when Barack Obama's former vice-president was a private citizen. He says he asked Joe Biden's brother, James, whether the family was concerned about possible scrutiny of the former vice-president's involvement in a potential business deal with a Chinese entity. Mr Bobulinski told Fox News that James Biden had replied: "Plausible deniability." Mr Bobulinski was invited by Mr Trump to be his guest at the final presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee on 22 October. What is known about Hunter's dealings in China? In 2013, Hunter flew aboard Air Force Two with his father, who was then vice-president, on an official visit to Beijing, where the younger Biden met investment banker Jonathan Li. Hunter told the New Yorker he had just met Mr Li for "a cup of coffee", but 12 days after the trip a private equity fund, BHR Partners, was approved by the Chinese authorities. Mr Li was chief executive and Hunter was a board member. He would hold a 10% stake. Getty Images Joe Biden walks out of Air Force Two with his granddaughter and son, Hunter Biden BHR is backed by some of China's largest state banks and by local governments, according to US media. Hunter Biden's lawyer said he had joined the board in an unpaid position "based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets". His lawyer also said his client did not acquire his financial stake in BHR until 2017, after his father had left office in the US. Hunter resigned from the board of BHR in April 2020, but still held his 10% stake in BHR as of July this year, according to the company report. What did the New York Post say about Hunter Biden and Ukraine? The New York Post reported an email from April 2015, in which an adviser to Burisma, Vadym Pozharskyi, apparently thanked Hunter Biden for inviting him to meet his father in Washington. Hunter was a director on the board of Burisma - a Ukrainian-owned private energy company while his father was the Obama administration's pointman on US-Ukrainian relations. Hunter was one of several foreigners on its board. The New York Post article did not provide evidence that the meeting had ever taken place. The Biden election campaign said there was no record of any such meeting on the former vice-president's "official schedule" from the time. But in a statement to Politico , the campaign also acknowledged that Mr Biden could have had an "informal interaction" with the Burisma adviser that did not appear on his official schedule, though it said any such encounter would have been "cursory". "Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague, have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official US policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing," said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr Biden. What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Biden's team has also decried the New York Post story as "Russian disinformation", though it did not say the emails were bogus. The New York Post article was shared by President Trump and his allies. Two of his former advisers, Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani, were involved in providing the story and the hard drive containing the alleged emails, to the newspaper. Mr Giuliani says the messages were found on a laptop that Hunter dropped off at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. Sceptics have noted that Mr Giuliani travelled in December 2019 to Kyiv where he met Ukrainian lawmaker Andriy Derkach, whom the US Treasury has designated as a longtime Kremlin agent. Mr Giuliani has acknowledged trying dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine. But the US Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, told Fox Business that the purported emails were not connected to a Russian disinformation effort. Other US media say they have been unable to verify the authenticity of the emails. Hunter has neither confirmed nor denied that he dropped off a laptop at the location. Hunter joined Burisma in 2014, and remained on the board until April 2019, when he decided to leave. Speaking to the BBC, he said Burisma had seen his name "as gold" and that it had played a large part in his appointment to the board. Twitter and Facebook's action over Joe Biden article reignites bias claims What are the Bidens accused of in Ukraine? Donald Trump and his allies accused Joe Biden of wrongdoing because he had pushed, while vice-president, for the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, who was investigating the company for which Hunter worked. In 2016, Joe Biden called for the dismissal of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin, whose office had Burisma and other companies under investigation. However, other Western leaders and major bodies that give financial support to Ukraine also wanted the prosecutor dismissed because they believed he was not active enough in tackling corruption. What else has the Biden campaign said? Shortly before the final presidential debate last year, the Democrat's camp released a statement denying wrongdoing. "Joe Biden has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever," said the statement. "He has never held stock in any such business arrangements nor has any family member or any other person ever held stock for him. "What is true is that Tony Bobulinski admitted on the record to Breitbart that he is angry that he was *not* able to go into business with Hunter and James Biden [Joe Biden's brother]." What did this have to do with impeachment? In 2019, details emerged of a phone call Mr Trump, the then president, had made to the president of Ukraine, in which he had urged the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens. President Trump's impeachment explained This led to charges by the Democrats that Mr Trump was trying to illegally pressure Ukraine to help damage his election rival, resulting in impeachment by the House of Representatives. Mr Trump denied he had done anything wrong, and he was later acquitted by the Republican-controlled US Senate. Getty Images President Trump holds a copy of The Washington Post the day after the US Senate acquitted him on two articles of impeachment Has anything been proven against the Bidens? While no criminal activity has been proven, it has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. A senior State Department official raised such concerns as far back as 2015. Joe Biden's son defends foreign dealings US Republican lawmakers launched an investigation and found last year that Hunter's work for the Ukrainian firm had been "problematic" - but there wasn't evidence that US foreign policy was influenced by it. No criminal charges were proven against Burisma either. The company issued a statement in 2017 saying "all legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations" against it were closed. Last year, Yuriy Lutsenko, the prosecutor in Ukraine who succeeded Viktor Shokin, told the BBC that there was no reason to investigate the Bidens under Ukrainian law. There is nothing illegal about sitting on a board of a company whilst family members serve in government. Hunter Biden's lawyers said in statement in October 2019 that he had undertaken "these business activities independently. He did not believe it appropriate to discuss them with his father, nor did he." Hunter told the New Yorker magazine that on the only occasion he had mentioned Burisma: "Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing.'" Amid all the scrutiny, Joe Biden promised last year that if he was elected president, no-one in his family would hold a job or have a business relationship with a foreign corporation or foreign government.

For the controversy surrounding Hunter Biden's laptop, see Hunter Biden laptop controversy . For allegations of corruption by the Bidens, see United States House Oversight Committee investigation into the Biden family . Viktor Shokin Joe Biden Hunter Biden Some of the primary subjects of the conspiracy theory The Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory is a series of false allegations that Joe Biden , while he was vice president of the United States , improperly withheld a loan guarantee and took a bribe to pressure Ukraine into firing prosecutor general Viktor Shokin to prevent a corruption investigation of Ukrainian gas company Burisma and to protect his son Hunter Biden , who was on the Burisma board . [ 1 ] As part of efforts by Donald Trump [ 2 ] and his campaign in the Trump–Ukraine scandal , which led to Trump's first impeachment , these falsehoods were spread in an attempt to damage Joe Biden's reputation and chances during the 2020 presidential campaign , and later in an effort to impeach him. [ 3 ] Joe Biden followed State Department intentions when he withheld the loan guarantee to pressure Ukraine into removing the prosecutor, [ 4 ] [ 5 ] who was seen as corrupt and failing to clean up Ukrainian corruption, [ 6 ] in accordance with the official and bipartisan policy of the United States , the European Union , the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] A confidential informant told the FBI that Burisma's owner said he was coerced to pay bribes to both Bidens to ensure Shokin was fired, though the informant was indicted in 2024 on charges he had fabricated the account. United States intelligence community analysis released in March 2021 found that proxies of Russian intelligence promoted and laundered misleading or unsubstantiated narratives about the Bidens "to US media organizations, US officials, and prominent US individuals, including some close to former President Trump and his administration." [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] The New York Times reported in May 2021 that a federal criminal investigation was examining a possible role by current and former Ukrainian officials, including whether they used former Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani , who was the subject of a separate but related federal investigation, to spread unsubstantiated claims. [ 13 ] A joint investigation by two Republican Senate committees released in September 2020 found no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe Biden. A sweeping Republican House committee investigation of the Biden family has found no wrongdoing by December 2023. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] House Speaker Kevin McCarthy directed three committees to open a formal impeachment inquiry in September 2023, and on December 2 his successor Mike Johnson said he believed Republicans had enough votes in the House to initiate impeachment proceedings . The three committees released a report in August 2024 asserting Biden had "engaged in impeachable conduct," but they did not recommend proceeding to impeachment. [ 18 ] Background See also: Conspiracy theories related to the Trump–Ukraine scandal Since the Independence of Ukraine following the collapse of the Soviet Union , Russia has had a history of running direct and active measures to undermine the sovereignty of Ukraine. [ 19 ] This included placing operatives in the government, influencing elections, and encouraging corruption. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] [ 22 ] After the start of the Russo-Ukrainian War , when Russia invaded Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, Russia began to take active measures to influence presidential elections in the United States . [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Beginning in 2014, this included efforts to discredit Joe Biden . [ 25 ] The series of false allegations about Joe Biden and Burisma [ 25 ] emerged at a convergence of interest between Russian efforts to help Trump's candidacy, [ 26 ] operatives and supporters of the Trump campaign, [ 27 ] and media in the United States. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] The thesis of the false conspiracy theory asserts that Joe Biden sought the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor to protect his son, [ 26 ] and that he did it in a quid pro quo manner by trading loan guarantees for the personal favor. This is in contrast to the attempted quid pro quo by President Trump, who unsuccessfully tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a quid pro quo manner to start a publicly announced investigation of Burisma and the Bidens in exchange for military aid and a visit to the White House. Trump's effort resulted in his first impeachment. [ 25 ] In January 2018, a videotaping by the Council on Foreign Relations shows Biden taking credit for withholding the loan guarantees to have the prosecutor fired. [ 30 ] His actions were implementations of bipartisan US policy rather than done for any of the reasons alleged in the conspiracy theory. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] Bribery allegation In June 2020, a confidential informant, later convicted for false statements to the FBI, [ 33 ] Alexander Smirnov , lied to the FBI that Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevsky had said he had been coerced into paying Hunter Biden a $5 million bribe, as well as a $5 million bribe to "another Biden," to ensure Shokin would be fired. The FBI memorialized Smirnov's lies in an FD-1023 form , which read in part: Zlochevsky said he had a total of "17 recordings" involving the Bidens; two of the recordings included Joe Biden, and the remaining 15 recordings only included Hunter Biden. [The informant] reiterated that, per Zlochevsky, these recordings evidence Zlochevsky was somehow coerced into paying the Bidens to ensure Ukraine Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin was fired. [ 4 ] [ 34 ] Smirnov also told the FBI that Zlochevsky said Burisma had hired Hunter Biden to "protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems." [ 35 ] The FD-1023 came to the attention of the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee investigation of the Biden family in 2023, leading to allegations of bribery that contributed to the Republican-controlled House voting to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Biden in December 2023. Republican committee member Nancy Mace asserted in a September 2023 public hearing, "We already know the president took bribes from Burisma." [ 36 ] In February 2024, Smirnov was arrested by the FBI upon arriving in Las Vegas on a flight from an overseas location. He was indicted on charges that he had fabricated his account of conversations with Zlochevsky. The indictment asserted Smirnov appeared to have a political bias against Joe Biden, telling FBI handlers during the 2020 presidential campaign that he had evidence that would put Biden in jail. [ 35 ] [ 37 ] Days after the indictment, prosecutors said Smirnov had admitted Russian intelligence officials had passed a false story about Hunter Biden to him and Smirnov had been "actively peddling new lies that could impact US elections" since meeting with Russian agents in late 2023. Prosecutors also said Smirnov is a dual U.S. and Israeli citizen who should be detained pending trial; the presiding magistrate judge ordered him released provided he surrender his passports and wear a GPS monitor. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] In December 2024, Smirnov pleaded guilty to one count of lying to the FBI and was sentenced to six years in prison the following month. [ 40 ] [ 41 ] Conspirators The falsehoods about Hunter Biden were spread by possible Russian operatives in the Ukrainian parliament, [ 42 ] right-wing media supportive of Trump, [ 25 ] and members of the Trump campaign, such as Rudy Giuliani and Steve Bannon . [ 43 ] Russian involvement Russian involvement was coordinated by Russian GRU lieutenant general Vladimir Alekseyevin , his deputy Oleksiy Savin, and Ihor Kolesnikov. [ 44 ] They coordinated a network spreading the false allegations through Ukrainian lawmakers Oleksandr Dubinsky and Andrii Derkach , Prosecutor Kostiantyn Kulyk and businessmen Dmytro Firtash and Konstantin Kilimnik . [ 25 ] The three were given ten million dollars [ 45 ] and used corrupt access to the Ukrainian Parliament and connections to media and politicians in the United States to spread the falsehoods. [ 46 ] Dubinsky, Derkach and Kulyk were sanctioned by the U.S. government in the closing days of the Trump administration, and in November 2023 Ukrainian authorities indicted them on treason charges. [ 47 ] Ihor Kolesnikov Ihor Kolesnikov, a Soviet-era GRU officer, coordinated the election subversion network from Kyiv. [ 48 ] Kolesnikov would organize Press Conferences for Oleksander Dubinsky and Andri Derkach. He was sentenced to fifteen years for treason in May 2022. [ 48 ] Oleksander Dubinsky Oleksandr Dubinsky is a member of the Ukrainian Parliament who four years ago helped Rudy Giuliani in his attempts to find information in support of the false Biden-Ukraine conspiracy. Dubinsky is accused of treason for allegedly working to help Russia in its war against Ukraine. [ 45 ] Dubinsky held Press Conference with Andrii Derkach to spread the false rumors. [ 47 ] He also met with Rudy Giuliani in 2019 for the production of a falsified film about the conspiracy. [ 49 ] In May 2021 Dubinsky was sanctioned by the US Government, his assets frozen, and his YouTube channel shutdown. In November 2023 Oleksander Dubinsky was charged for carrying out subversive informational activities by publishing "fakes about the alleged interference of Ukrainian high-ranking officials" in the U.S. 2020 presidential elections. [ 48 ] Andrii Derkach Andrii Derkach is a former Ukrainian politician, now stripped of citizenship, [ 50 ] who is believed to have been an agent or asset of Russia. [ 51 ] He played a central role in spreading falsehoods about Biden and Ukraine. [ 25 ] Derkach released snippets of a supposed conversation between Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Poroshenko, in which Biden linked loan guarantees to the ouster of Viktor Shokin, the country's corrupt and ineffective prosecutor general. [ 5 ] The recordings, which were not verified as authentic and appeared to be heavily edited, [ 52 ] did not provide evidence to support the ongoing conspiracy theory that Biden wanted the prosecutor fired to protect his son. [ 53 ] In June 2020, Poroshenko denied that Joe Biden ever approached him about Burisma and characterized the recordings as fake. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] In September 2020, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Derkach, stating he "has been an active Russian agent for over a decade, maintaining close connections with the Russian Intelligence Services". The Treasury Department added that Derkach "waged a covert influence campaign centered on cultivating false and unsubstantiated narratives concerning U.S. officials in the upcoming 2020 Presidential Election," including by the release of "edited audio tapes and other unsupported information with the intent to discredit U.S. officials". [ 56 ] [ 57 ] Kostiantyn Kulyk In 2019, as deputy prosecutor general. Mr Kulyk wrote a 2019 memo calling for an investigation into Hunter Biden's role on Burisma's board. [ 47 ] Later that year he had plans to meet Mr Giuliani to discuss the allegations in order to spread the false conspiracy. [ 58 ] Kulyk has been indicted on multiple corruption charges. [ 59 ] Kulyk, though, fled Ukraine after Russia's invasion in 2022 [ 47 ] and is also sanctioned by the United States for his role in the subversive activities. [ 60 ] Dmytro Firtash Dmytro Firtash was a middleman for Gazprom and connected to the Ukrainian government. [ 61 ] He has acknowledged that he was installed as a middleman by Russian mob boss Semion Mogilevich . [ 62 ] Since 2014 Firtash has faced bribery charges and fought extradition to the United States while he has been released on bail in Austria. He wired one million dollars to the wife of Lev Parnas , a former associate of Giuliani. He provided a now-discredited affidavit from Kulyk accusing Biden of wrongdoing. Trump and Giuliani associates Joe DiGenova and Victoria Toensing attempted to persuade Attorney General William Barr to drop charges against Firtash but failed. [ 62 ] Konstantin Kilimnik Konstantin Kilimnik oversaw a network of people working on behalf of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) to influence the 2020 elections. [ 63 ] Kilimnik had the single strongest ties, authorized by President Putin , [ 64 ] to the Trump administration in both 2016 and 2020 elections. [ 65 ] He organized Russia's media outreach campaigns to spread lies about Biden and corruption in Ukraine as part of Russia's efforts to help Trump. [ 66 ] [ 67 ] American media involvement American media organizations with ties to the Trump campaign were involved in the spread of the false allegations. [ 25 ] Specifically Peter Schweizer , [ 68 ] John Solomon , [ 25 ] Fox News , [ 69 ] and One America News Network [ 70 ] were essential in creating and disseminating the lies that built the background for this conspiracy theory. Peter Schweizer Peter Schweizer , editor-at-large at Breitbart News and president of the conservative Government Accountability Institute , was the first person to spread the falsehoods about Joe Biden and Burisma in his book "Secret Empires". [ 25 ] The plagiarized book [ 71 ] included a false story that on January 12, 2017, Joe Biden, who was then the vice-president, sought to end an investigation into Burisma to protect Hunter Biden, who had a profitable post on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company run by a shady oligarch. [ 25 ] Schweizer launched a media blitz in 2019 to help the conspiracy spread and appeared and wrote editorials repeating his lie in multiple news outlets. [ 72 ] This, in turn, helped to lead Trump allies in Ukraine [ 73 ] and Congress to promote the lie. [ 74 ] John Solomon Washington Post attributes John Solomon , formerly of The Hill , the most responsibility [ 75 ] for the spread of the untrue claims in U.S. media. [ 25 ] Beginning in the spring of 2019, Solomon published a series of editorials which The Hill notes are now part of Congressional inquiries due to their connection to the spreading of lies. Solomon relied heavily on Schweizer's book. [ 25 ] The story being pushed by Solomon had significant flaws, [ 75 ] including relying on a corrupt source who would not substantiate the claims. [ 76 ] In testimony before Congress, Alexander Vindman said Solomon's claims were "entirely made up in full cloth". [ 77 ] Media Matters reported in September 2023 that the previous month Solomon published a State Department briefing memo prepared for Joe Biden's December 2015 trip to Ukraine. The memo read, in part: There is wide agreement that anti-corruption must be at the top of this list, and that reforms must include an overhaul of the Prosecutor General's Office including removal of Prosecutor General Shokin, who is widely regarded as an obstacle to fighting corruption, if not a source of the problem. [ 78 ] Fox News Fox News was also involved in the spread of the falsehoods. [ 69 ] Fox ran at least twelve broadcasts about John Solomon's report about the Burisma probe. The false conspiracy theory was mentioned on Sean Hannity 's program, with him claiming Solomon had caught Joe Biden in an "international corruption scandal". [ 79 ] [ 80 ] One America News Network One America News Network (OANN) is a far-right , pro-Trump news outlet with reporters who also work for Russian news agencies, [ 70 ] and the network was essential to spreading lies about Biden and Burisma. [ 81 ] OANN produced a "documentary series intended to debunk the impeachment case", and an OANN crew traveled with Rudy Giuliani to Ukraine to gather information. [ 58 ] OANN later aired a misleading documentary about Biden and Burisma called " The Ukraine Hoax: Impeachment, Biden Cash, and Mass Murder " [ 82 ] produced by Michael Caputo , [ 81 ] a member of the Trump campaign, and Sergey Petrushin , a Russian living in Florida. The documentary used fake documents provided to Giuliani by Parnas on behalf of Andrii Derkach and Konstantin Kilimnik . [ 69 ] Following Caputo's work in spreading the falsehoods through OANN, Donald Trump made Caputo the assistant secretary of public affairs for the Department of Health and Human Services . Trump campaign involvement The Trump campaign's actions in spreading the conspiracy, especially the active engagement of Rudy Giuliani with possible Russian agents, [ 83 ] were highlighted during Donald Trump's first impeachment . [ 84 ] Trump's first impeachment Trump's first impeachment charge of abuse of power was triggered by a July 2019 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , in which then-President Trump unsuccessfully tried to pressure Zelenskyy in a quid pro quo manner to start a publicly announced investigation of Burisma and the Bidens in exchange for the release of congressionally mandated financial and military aid to Ukraine and the promise of a Trump–Zelenskyy meeting at the White House. [ 85 ] During the hearings and impeachment trial of President Trump in 2019–20, he and his allies repeatedly alleged that Joe Biden and his son had engaged in corrupt activities in Ukraine. [ 84 ] [ 86 ] Trump said he planned to make it a major issue during the 2020 United States presidential election , [ 87 ] while a Republican-controlled Senate committee carried out an investigation into the allegations in spring 2020. [ 88 ] The investigation by the Republican-controlled Senate Homeland Security and Finance Committees concluded in September 2020 that Hunter Biden " ' cashed in' on his father's name to close lucrative business deals around the world", but that there was no evidence of improper influence or wrongdoing by Joe Biden. [ 89 ] Rudy Giuliani Working together with Andrii Derkach (an active Russian agent), [ 56 ] Dmytro Firtash , and other individuals linked to Russian intelligence and organized crime, [ 90 ] [ 54 ] Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani , and his associates spearheaded an effort to gather information in Ukraine to advance the allegations, and Attorney General William Barr confirmed that the Justice Department had created an "intake process" to review Giuliani's findings. [ 91 ] In late 2019, it was revealed that the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York , which Giuliani had once led, was investigating him for multiple felonies relating to his activities in Ukraine. [ 92 ] [ 93 ] Intelligence officials warned Ron Johnson , the chairman of the Senate committee investigating the Bidens, that he risked spreading Russian disinformation. [ 94 ] The Washington Post reported in October 2020 that American intelligence agencies warned the White House in 2019 that Giuliani was the target of a Russian influence operation, and National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien warned President Trump about accepting what Giuliani told him. While monitoring Russian assets, U.S. intelligence recorded Giuliani communicating with them. [ 95 ] According to officials interviewed by The Daily Beast , then-National Security Advisor John Bolton told his staff not to meet with Giuliani, as did his successor Robert C. O'Brien, because Bolton had been informed that Giuliani was spreading conspiracy theories that aligned with Russian interests in disrupting the 2020 election. These officials were also concerned that Giuliani would be used as a conduit for disinformation, including "leaks" of emails that would mix genuine with forged material to implicate Hunter Biden in corrupt dealings. [ 96 ] Interviewed by The Daily Beast, Giuliani would later declare that Derkach's being sanctioned was the result of a conspiracy led by George Soros and that "the chance that Derkach is a Russian spy is no better than 50/50". [ 97 ] In October 2020, during the last weeks of the presidential campaign, the New York Post published an article, with the involvement of Donald Trump's personal attorney Giuliani and former chief strategist Steve Bannon , about a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden . The laptop contained an email, the authenticity of which was later verified by The Washington Post in 2022, [ 98 ] showing what the New York Post characterized as a "meeting" between Joe Biden and Vadym Pozharskyi, a Burisma advisor, in 2015, though that characterization was disputed by witnesses. [ 5 ] The article's veracity was strongly questioned by most mainstream media outlets, analysts and intelligence officials, due to the chain of custody of the laptop and its contents, and suspicion that it may have been part of a disinformation campaign. [ 99 ] [ 100 ] [ 101 ] A Republican activist delivered a portable drive to the Washington Post and stated that the device contained data copied from the laptop. The Post confirmed that some of the materials provided to them were genuine, but could not confirm that the materials on the portable drive came from the purported laptop; the Post also concluded that most of the data could not be verified and fake material may have been mixed in with it. [ 98 ] Hunter Biden said that it is possible the laptop could be his. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] Ukrainian businessman Hares Youssef told The Times that an associate of Dmytro Firtash asked Youssef to lie about Hunter Biden's business dealings to damage Joe Biden's presidential campaign, in exchange for a United States visa. [ 104 ] Subjects of the conspiracy The false allegations asserted that Joe Biden asked for the dismissal of Viktor Shokin to cover up crimes by his son Hunter Biden. [ 25 ] Viktor Shokin Viktor Shokin was appointed to the position of Prosecutor General of Ukraine by Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko , to whom he was loyal. Due to his own corruption and failures to do his job to clean up corruption, representatives of the EU , the United States , the World Bank , and International Monetary Fund , [ 6 ] pressed Poroshenko for his removal. [ 105 ] In March 2016 testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , former ambassador to Ukraine John E. Herbst stated, "By late fall of 2015, the EU and the United States joined the chorus of those seeking Mr. Shokin's removal" and that Joe Biden "spoke publicly about this before and during his December visit to Kyiv". During the same hearing, assistant secretary of state Victoria Nuland stated, "we have pegged our next $1 billion loan guarantee, first and foremost, to having a rebooting of the reform coalition so that we know who we are working with, but secondarily, to ensuring that the prosecutor general's office gets cleaned up." [ 8 ] An overwhelming majority vote in the Ukrainian Parliament in March 2016 led to Shokin's removal from office [ 106 ] after an investigation into extortion of another company led to associates who were found in possession of diamonds, cash and other valuables, [ 107 ] as well as documents and passports belonging to Shokin. [ 108 ] In an August 2023 Fox News interview, Shokin said he was fired as prosecutor general "at the insistence of then-Vice President [Biden] because I was investigating Burisma." One month later, Poroshenko was asked on Fox News for his reaction to Shokin's assertion. Poroshenko responded: First of all, this is a completely crazy person. There is something wrong with him. Second, there is not one single word of truth. And third, I hate the idea to make any comments and to make any intervention in an American election. We have very much enjoyed the bipartisan support, and please, do not use such a person like Shokin to undermine the trust between bipartisan support and Ukraine. The Fox News interviewer responded, "Okay, so that is not true. He didn't get fired because of Joe Biden." Poroshenko confirmed this, adding Shokin was fired by the Ukrainian parliament "for his own statement" and "he played a very dirty game unfortunately." [ 109 ] [ 110 ] Hunter Biden Hunter Biden is a lawyer whose career previously included a period as an executive vice president at MBNA and three years at the United States Department of Commerce . He then worked as a lobbyist until 2006, when George W. Bush appointed him to the board of directors of Amtrak . Hunter Biden resigned from Amtrak in February 2009, shortly after the inauguration of Barack Obama , when his father Joe Biden became vice-president. He resumed lobbying, and was counsel at the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP , until the Ukrainian oil and gas firm Burisma Holdings appointed him to its board of directors in April 2014. [ 111 ] As Hunter Biden had no prior experience in Ukraine or the energy sector, some viewed this as a likely attempt to buy influence via his father, though Hunter Biden was hired to conduct general corporate consulting rather than to provide energy expertise. [ 112 ] Hunter Biden's employment was described by some as a potential conflict of interest , and advisors to the Obama administration considered the situation awkward. [ 113 ] Former Politico reporter Marc Caputo said in January 2025 that in 2019 the campaign of a rival to Biden for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election gave him opposition research on Burisma. "That story was killed by the editors, and they gave no explanation for that either", he recalled, citing it and orders to not report on the laptop as among examples of "dumb decisions of cowardly editors" regarding Hunter Biden. [ 114 ] Congressional investigations After Republicans took control of the House in January 2023, three House committees initiated investigations into Joe Biden, his family, and the Justice Department. In September 2023, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy authorized the committees to open a formal impeachment inquiry , to be led by James Comer , chairman of the House investigation into the Biden family . McCarthy had days earlier said that he would hold a full House vote to authorize an inquiry. [ 115 ] The Washington Post reported that during a November 7 luncheon with the Republican Governance Group , McCarthy's successor Mike Johnson indicated there was insufficient evidence to initiate formal impeachment proceedings . [ 116 ] Johnson said on December 2 that he believed he had enough House votes to continue to impeachment proceedings, as Republicans said a vote might be held within days, though they acknowledged they had not found evidence of misconduct by the president. [ 117 ] [ 118 ] [ 17 ] Lev Parnas testimony At the invitation of committee Democrats, on March 20, 2024, Parnas testified before the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee investigation into the Biden family that was pursuing the impeachment of President Joe Biden . [ 119 ] [ 120 ] [ 121 ] Parnas stated he was tasked by Giuliani with "finding dirt on the Bidens" to "spread misinformation about them" but he was unable to find evidence of Biden corruption in Ukraine. [ 122 ] He testified, in part: [ 123 ] The American people have been lied to, by Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani and various cohorts of individuals in government and media positions. They created falsehoods to serve their own interests knowing it would undermine the strength of our nation ... Congressman Pete Sessions , then-Congressman Devin Nunes , Senator Ron Johnson and many others understood they were pushing a false narrative. The same goes for John Solomon , Sean Hannity and media personnel, particularly with Fox News , who used this narrative to manipulate the public ahead of the 2020 elections. Sadly, they are still doing this today as we approach the 2024 elections ... The only information ever pushed on the Bidens and Ukraine has come from one source and one source only: Russia and Russian agents.

Hunter Biden is expressing regret for being discharged from the Navy Reserve amid published reports that he tested positive for cocaine. The Wall Street Journal reports that Hunter Biden failed the drug test last year and was discharged in February. In a statement issued Thursday, Oct. 16, Biden doesn’t say why he was discharged. He says he’s embarrassed that his actions led to his discharge and that he respects the Navy’s decision.(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File) Read More 2 of 3 | FILE - This Dec. 4, 2013, file photo shows U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, left, arriving on Air Force Two in Beijing, China, with his son Hunter Biden, right, and his granddaughter Finnegan Biden. As the Vice President travels to Ukraine Saturday, June 7, 2014, his youngest son, Hunter, 44, has been hired by a private Ukrainian company that promotes energy independence from Russia, but is commercially active in the breakaway Russian-backed state of Crimea and owned by a former government minister with ties to Ukraine’s ousted pro-Russian president.

(AP Photo/Sergei Chuzavkov) Read More By Stephen Braun Share Share Facebook Copy Link copied Print Email X LinkedIn Bluesky Flipboard Pinterest Reddit WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. Vice President Joe Biden’s visit Saturday to support Ukraine’s fragile democracy came soon after his youngest son was hired by a private Ukrainian company that promotes energy independence from Moscow. Yet that company leases natural gas fields in the breakaway Russian-backed state of Crimea and is owned by a former government minister with ties to Ukraine’s ousted pro-Russian president. The hiring of Hunter Biden, 44, by Burisma Holdings Limited in April was approved by the company’s owner, a former senior minister and political ally of Viktor Yanukovych, the exiled Ukrainian president. Yanukovych fled to Russia in February after protests erupted over his efforts to establish closer economic ties with Moscow. Hunter Biden’s employment means he will be working as a director and top lawyer for a Ukrainian energy company during the period when his father and others in the Obama administration attempt to influence the policies of Ukraine’s new government, especially on energy issues. There’s no indication that Hunter Biden, his father or Burisma are crossing any legal or ethical lines, although ethics experts appear divided over the implications of Hunter Biden’s new job. American conflict-of-interest laws and federal ethics rules essentially do not regulate the business activities of adult relatives of those who work in the White House. “The primary problem here is the fact that Hunter Biden has set up a financial arrangement with someone who might have business pending before this administration,” said Craig Holman, an ethics expert with Public Citizen, a Washington-based government reform organization. Joe Biden led the U.S. delegation at Saturday’s inauguration of Ukraine’s new president, Petro Poroshenko, and announced $48 million in additional aid for the Kiev government. Biden met Poroshenko and said “there is a window for peace and you know as well as anyone that it will not stay open indefinitely ... America is with you.” Ukraine is an important natural-gas and petroleum-liquids transit country. Two major pipeline systems carry Russian gas through Ukraine to Western Europe. Burisma is headed by Nikolai Zlochevskyi, who held senior posts over natural resources, environment and defense in Ukraine. The company has aggressively bought up Ukrainian oil and natural gas leases and companies. Hunter Biden’s new company says it aims to reduce Ukraine’s dependence on Russian gas and oil, a goal that parallels U.S. efforts to aid Ukraine’s energy industry. As a Burisma director and the company’s top lawyer, the younger Biden has yet to take any public actions on behalf of the company. But the timing of his hiring is politically awkward for the administration’s efforts to shore up Ukraine’s pro-Western government, and poses potential complications from Burisma’s growing energy interests and the background of Hunter Biden’s new boss, Zlochevskyi. At least two oil and natural gas fields leased by subsidiaries of Burisma are in Ukrainian territories where pro-Russian sentiments remain strong, according to government and media releases, independent energy maps and Burisma’s website. One is in the breakaway Russian-backed state of Crimea; the other is in the eastern Ukrainian Kharkiv region. Instability there could force the younger Biden’s new company to coordinate with pro-Russian separatists whom the U.S. considers illegitimate. White House officials declined to comment on Hunter Biden’s association with Burisma and the company’s holdings in Crimea and east Ukraine. The vice president’s spokeswoman, Kendra Barkoff, previously said that Biden’s son is a private citizen and a lawyer, and that Joe Biden “does not endorse any particular company and has no involvement with this company.” Presidents and vice presidents have long been vexed by relatives rewarded for family ties. Political loan troubles shadowed Vice President Richard Nixon’s brother, Donald, during the 1960 election, and President Jimmy Carter’s brother, Billy, who accepted a $220,000 stipend in 1981 from Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi. In recent years, several Bush and Clinton relatives were caught in a string of murky financial and political dealings. But “unless there’s solid evidence that Hunter Biden got his job to influence American foreign policy, there’s no clear line that’s been crossed,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. A former Washington lobbyist, the vice president’s son is effectively exempt from most rules that would require him to describe publicly the legal work he does on behalf of Burisma. Hunter Biden will not lobby for the company, said Lawrence Pacheco, an official with FTI Consulting, a Washington government affairs company recently hired by Burisma. Pacheco did not say whether Biden might oversee or advise on any future Burisma lobbying strategy in the U.S. Pacheco said the company “does not take positions on political matters.” But Biden’s company may have to deal with Ukrainian enclaves that the U.S. does not recognize diplomatically or are threatened by instability. One Burisma subsidiary, KrymTopEnergoServis, operates natural gas fields and has headquarters in the Crimea, which seceded from Ukraine this year and now aligns with Russia. A second subsidiary, Esco-Pivnich, produces oil and natural gas just west of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, which was the site of several protests and borders on separatist-controlled provinces. The company’s website confirms that Burisma operates oil and natural gas sites in Crimea and east Ukraine, as well as elsewhere in Ukraine. “While he’s just at the beginning of his involvement with this company, Ukraine is volatile right now and there are all sorts of problems that might crop up down the line,” said Bill Allison, the editorial director of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan watchdog group. Pacheco said the company’s western and eastern operations have been unaffected by Ukraine’s unrest but that its Crimea subsidiary is not operating currently. He did not explain further, but confirmed KrymTopEnergoServis is based and leases gas deposits in Crimea. Hunter Biden, Zlochevskyi and other company officials would not comment publicly, Pacheco said. Hunter Biden is a managing director with Rosemont Seneca Partners, a private equity firm, and worked as a Washington lobbyist for seven years until his father was elected vice president. He lobbied primarily for colleges, hospitals and tech firms. Pacheco said Biden’s son came to Burisma’s attention after he was introduced by Devon Archer, another new Burisma board member, to Alan Apter, Burisma’s board chairman. Archer works with Hunter Biden at Rosemont and was a top fundraiser for now-Secretary of State John Kerry when Kerry ran for president in 2004. Zlochevskyi approved Biden’s hiring, Pacheco said. Zlochevskyi, 48, worked as minister of natural resources and environment under Yanukovych and most recently was deputy secretary of Ukraine’s national security and defense council, which advised Yanukovych on defense matters. Zlochevskyi also served in the Ukrainian parliament from 2007 to 2011 as a member of the Party of Regions, the political party affiliated with Yanukovych and traditionally aligned with pro-Russian interests. Zlochevskyi’s name is missing from Burisma’s web site, but financial documents in Cyprus as well as U.S. Securities and Exchange records show that he owns the bulk of Burisma’s shares. Zlochevskyi’s Cyprus-based Brociti Investments Limited controls Burisma. Hunter Biden joined Burisma in April, the same month his father visited Kiev to show support for the new interim government. ___ Associated Press writers Menelaos Hadjicostis in Nicosia, Cyprus, and Laura Mills in Kiev contributed to this report.

During the 2020 election campaign, he and his father were frequently accused by Donald Trump and his associates of wrongdoing in regards to China and Ukraine, allegations which they both denied. The New York Post reported on an alleged email in which an adviser from a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, apparently thanked Hunter for inviting him to meet his father, Joe Biden. Asked about the allegations, Joe Biden told a reporter it was a "smear campaign". No criminal activity has been proven, and no evidence has emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. In an interview with the BBC months after his father was sworn in as president, Hunter Biden defended his qualifications for the position at Burisma but added that, in retrospect, he had "missed... the perception that I would create". Claims of influence-peddling are common in Washington DC and Mr Trump's children have also been accused of conflicts of interest in lucrative business deals overseas. They, too, deny wrongdoing. What do we know about the federal investigation? The Justice Department is investigating Hunter Biden's finances including scrutinising some of his past Chinese business dealings and other transactions, a "person familiar with the matter" told The Associated Press in December . The tax investigation was launched in 2018 but Hunter Biden said he had learned about it for the first time in December 2020. Asked about the investigation by US broadcaster CBS this April, the president's son said: "I'm co-operating, completely. And I'm absolutely certain, 100% certain, that at the end of the investigation, that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing." What have the Bidens been accused of in China? The New York Post cited a purported email from Hunter Biden in August 2017 indicating he was receiving a $10m annual fee from a Chinese billionaire for "introductions alone", though it is unclear who was involved in the alleged introductions. Another purported email, which Fox News said it had confirmed, reportedly refers to a deal pursued by Hunter involving China's largest private energy firm. It is said to include a cryptic mention of "10 held by H for the big guy". Fox News cited unnamed sources as saying "the big guy" in the purported email was a reference to Joe Biden. This message is said to be from May 2017. Both emails would date from when the former US vice-president was a private citizen. A former business associate of Hunter Biden has come forward to say he can confirm the allegations. Tony Bobulinski told Fox News that, contrary to Joe Biden's statements that he had nothing to do with his son's business affairs, Hunter had "frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals" in China. Mr Bobulinski, who is reportedly a US Navy veteran, separately told Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he had met on two occasions with Joe Biden to discuss business deals with China, the first time in May 2017 when Barack Obama's former vice-president was a private citizen. He says he asked Joe Biden's brother, James, whether the family was concerned about possible scrutiny of the former vice-president's involvement in a potential business deal with a Chinese entity. Mr Bobulinski told Fox News that James Biden had replied: "Plausible deniability." Mr Bobulinski was invited by Mr Trump to be his guest at the final presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee on 22 October. What is known about Hunter's dealings in China? In 2013, Hunter flew aboard Air Force Two with his father, who was then vice-president, on an official visit to Beijing, where the younger Biden met investment banker Jonathan Li. Hunter told the New Yorker he had just met Mr Li for "a cup of coffee", but 12 days after the trip a private equity fund, BHR Partners, was approved by the Chinese authorities. Mr Li was chief executive and Hunter was a board member. He would hold a 10% stake. Getty Images Joe Biden walks out of Air Force Two with his granddaughter and son, Hunter Biden BHR is backed by some of China's largest state banks and by local governments, according to US media. Hunter Biden's lawyer said he had joined the board in an unpaid position "based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets". His lawyer also said his client did not acquire his financial stake in BHR until 2017, after his father had left office in the US. Hunter resigned from the board of BHR in April 2020, but still held his 10% stake in BHR as of July this year, according to the company report. What did the New York Post say about Hunter Biden and Ukraine? The New York Post reported an email from April 2015, in which an adviser to Burisma, Vadym Pozharskyi, apparently thanked Hunter Biden for inviting him to meet his father in Washington. Hunter was a director on the board of Burisma - a Ukrainian-owned private energy company while his father was the Obama administration's pointman on US-Ukrainian relations. Hunter was one of several foreigners on its board. The New York Post article did not provide evidence that the meeting had ever taken place. The Biden election campaign said there was no record of any such meeting on the former vice-president's "official schedule" from the time. But in a statement to Politico , the campaign also acknowledged that Mr Biden could have had an "informal interaction" with the Burisma adviser that did not appear on his official schedule, though it said any such encounter would have been "cursory". "Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague, have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official US policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing," said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr Biden. What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Biden's team has also decried the New York Post story as "Russian disinformation", though it did not say the emails were bogus. The New York Post article was shared by President Trump and his allies. Two of his former advisers, Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani, were involved in providing the story and the hard drive containing the alleged emails, to the newspaper. Mr Giuliani says the messages were found on a laptop that Hunter dropped off at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. Sceptics have noted that Mr Giuliani travelled in December 2019 to Kyiv where he met Ukrainian lawmaker Andriy Derkach, whom the US Treasury has designated as a longtime Kremlin agent. Mr Giuliani has acknowledged trying dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine. But the US Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, told Fox Business that the purported emails were not connected to a Russian disinformation effort. Other US media say they have been unable to verify the authenticity of the emails. Hunter has neither confirmed nor denied that he dropped off a laptop at the location. Hunter joined Burisma in 2014, and remained on the board until April 2019, when he decided to leave. Speaking to the BBC, he said Burisma had seen his name "as gold" and that it had played a large part in his appointment to the board. Twitter and Facebook's action over Joe Biden article reignites bias claims What are the Bidens accused of in Ukraine? Donald Trump and his allies accused Joe Biden of wrongdoing because he had pushed, while vice-president, for the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, who was investigating the company for which Hunter worked. In 2016, Joe Biden called for the dismissal of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin, whose office had Burisma and other companies under investigation. However, other Western leaders and major bodies that give financial support to Ukraine also wanted the prosecutor dismissed because they believed he was not active enough in tackling corruption. What else has the Biden campaign said? Shortly before the final presidential debate last year, the Democrat's camp released a statement denying wrongdoing. "Joe Biden has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever," said the statement. "He has never held stock in any such business arrangements nor has any family member or any other person ever held stock for him. "What is true is that Tony Bobulinski admitted on the record to Breitbart that he is angry that he was *not* able to go into business with Hunter and James Biden [Joe Biden's brother]." What did this have to do with impeachment? In 2019, details emerged of a phone call Mr Trump, the then president, had made to the president of Ukraine, in which he had urged the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens. President Trump's impeachment explained This led to charges by the Democrats that Mr Trump was trying to illegally pressure Ukraine to help damage his election rival, resulting in impeachment by the House of Representatives. Mr Trump denied he had done anything wrong, and he was later acquitted by the Republican-controlled US Senate. Getty Images President Trump holds a copy of The Washington Post the day after the US Senate acquitted him on two articles of impeachment Has anything been proven against the Bidens? While no criminal activity has been proven, it has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. A senior State Department official raised such concerns as far back as 2015. Joe Biden's son defends foreign dealings US Republican lawmakers launched an investigation and found last year that Hunter's work for the Ukrainian firm had been "problematic" - but there wasn't evidence that US foreign policy was influenced by it. No criminal charges were proven against Burisma either. The company issued a statement in 2017 saying "all legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations" against it were closed. Last year, Yuriy Lutsenko, the prosecutor in Ukraine who succeeded Viktor Shokin, told the BBC that there was no reason to investigate the Bidens under Ukrainian law. There is nothing illegal about sitting on a board of a company whilst family members serve in government. Hunter Biden's lawyers said in statement in October 2019 that he had undertaken "these business activities independently. He did not believe it appropriate to discuss them with his father, nor did he." Hunter told the New Yorker magazine that on the only occasion he had mentioned Burisma: "Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing.'" Amid all the scrutiny, Joe Biden promised last year that if he was elected president, no-one in his family would hold a job or have a business relationship with a foreign corporation or foreign government.

He is the second son of former president Joe Biden and his first wife, Neilia Hunter Biden . Hunter Biden was a founding board member of BHR Partners , a Chinese investment company, in 2013, and later served on the board of Burisma Holdings , one of the largest private natural gas producers in Ukraine , from 2014 until his term expired in April 2019. He has worked as a lobbyist and legal representative for lobbying firms, a hedge fund principal, and a venture capital and private equity fund investor. Since early 2019, Hunter and his father have been the targets of false allegations that Joe pressured Ukraine to fire a prosecutor to protect Hunter , which intensified after the New York Post published an article in October 2020 about a laptop computer that had belonged to Hunter Biden . Biden was convicted of three federal firearms -related felony charges in June 2024 after he had admitted to illegally owning a gun while a drug user. His tax affairs have been under federal criminal investigation since late 2018, and in September 2024, he pled guilty to all of the tax charges. In December 2024, Biden's father pardoned him for all federal offenses committed between 2014 and 2024, including any potential offenses not yet discovered. Early life and education Further information: Biden family Biden as a child, c. 1980s Robert Hunter Biden was born on February 4, 1970, [ 1 ] in Wilmington, Delaware . He is the second son of Neilia Biden (née Hunter) and Joe Biden . [ 2 ] Hunter Biden's mother and younger sister Naomi were killed in an automobile crash on December 18, 1972. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Biden and his older brother Beau were also seriously injured but survived. Beau suffered multiple broken bones while Hunter sustained a fractured skull and severe traumatic brain injuries. [ 5 ] Both spent several months in the hospital, during which time their father was sworn into the U.S. Senate in January 1973. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Hunter and Beau later encouraged their father to marry again, [ 9 ] and Jill Jacobs Stevenson became their stepmother in 1977. [ 2 ] Biden's half-sister Ashley was born in 1981. [ 10 ] Like his father and brother, Biden attended the Catholic high school Archmere Academy in Claymont, Delaware . [ 2 ] He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Georgetown University in 1992. [ 2 ] During the year after he graduated from college, he served as a Jesuit volunteer at a church in Portland, Oregon , and met Kathleen Buhle , whom he married in 1993. [ 2 ] After attending the Georgetown University Law Center for one year, he transferred to Yale Law School and graduated in 1996. [ 2 ] Early career After graduating from law school in 1996, Biden accepted a consultant position at the bank holding company MBNA , whose employees donated more than $200,000 to his father's senate campaigns over the years. [ 2 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Biden delayed his start date at MBNA to serve as co-chair for his father's reelection campaign. [ 13 ] By 1998, Hunter Biden had risen to the rank of executive vice president. [ 2 ] Biden departed from MBNA in 1998. He then served at the United States Department of Commerce , focusing on ecommerce policy for President Bill Clinton's administration . [ 14 ] In 2001, Biden became a lobbyist, co-founding the firm of Oldaker, Biden & Belair. [ 15 ] According to Adam Entous of The New Yorker , Biden and his father established a relationship in which "[Joe] Biden wouldn't ask Hunter about his lobbying clients, and Hunter wouldn't tell his father about them". [ 2 ] In 2001, he was also rehired by MBNA as a consultant, where he was paid a yearly $100,000 retainer until 2005. [ 13 ] MBNA's rehiring of Biden was controversial because his father was pushing for passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act , which was beneficial to the credit card industry and supported by MBNA during Biden's time at the bank. [ 2 ] [ 16 ] The legislation made it more difficult to get bankruptcy protection. [ 16 ] Biden was appointed to a five-year term on the board of directors of Amtrak by President George W. Bush in 2006. [ 17 ] Biden was the board's vice chairman from July 2006 until he was replaced as vice chairman in January 2009. [ 18 ] He resigned from the board that February, [ 19 ] shortly after his father became vice president. Biden said during his father's vice-presidential campaign that it was time for his lobbying activities to end. [ 2 ] Investing, lobbying, and philanthropy In 2006, Biden and his uncle James Biden purchased international hedge fund Paradigm Global Advisors with an $8 million promissory note. [ 15 ] The joint promotion of the fund by an entity of the troubled Stanford Financial Group hastened the unwinding of the company in 2010. [ 20 ] In September 2008, Hunter Biden founded a consultancy company named Seneca Global Advisors that offered to help companies expand into foreign markets. [ 21 ] Biden was a partner in investment vehicles that included the name "Seneca" to denote his participation. [ 22 ] In 2009, Biden, Devon Archer, and Christopher Heinz founded the investment and advisory firm Rosemont Seneca Partners . [ 15 ] Biden also co-founded venture capital firm Eudora Global. [ 10 ] Biden held the position of counsel in the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP in 2014. [ 2 ] From 2011 to 2017, Biden was on the board of directors of World Food Program USA, a 501(c)(3) charity based in Washington, D.C., that supports the work of the UN World Food Programme ; he served as board chairman from 2011 to 2015. [ 23 ] A detailed analysis of Hunter Biden's hard drive by NBC News showed that Biden and his firm were paid $11 million from 2013 to 2018, [ 24 ] including $3.8 million in payments from CEFC China Energy , [ 25 ] a defunct oil and gas company with links to the Chinese Communist Party , [ 26 ] as well as from Burisma Holdings. [ 24 ] In the U.S. criminal tax case against Hunter Biden, prosecutors allege he accepted payments from Romanian businessman Gabriel Popoviciu to influence U.S. government agencies regarding a criminal probe in Romania. Hunter Biden has pleaded guilty on 5 September 2024 to tax evasion and related charges. The allegations date back to his work for Popoviciu in 2015, during Joe Biden's vice presidency. [ 27 ] BHR Partners Main article: BHR Partners From 2013 to 2020, Biden served as a member of the board of the China-based private equity fund BHR Partners , of which he acquired a 10% stake in 2017 at a discount to actual value and with borrowed money. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] The founders of BHR Partners included Biden's Rosemont Seneca Partners investment firm (20% equity), along with US-based Thornton Group LLC (10% equity) and two asset managers registered in China. [ 30 ] [ 2 ] [ 21 ] The Chinese-registered asset managers are the Bank of China (via BOC International Holdings -backed Bohai Industrial Investment Fund Management) and Deutsche Bank -backed Harvest Fund Management . [ 31 ] In September 2019, while President Donald Trump was accusing Hunter Biden of malfeasance in Ukraine, he also falsely claimed that Biden "walk[ed] out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund". [ 32 ] Later in 2019, The Wall Street Journal confirmed that Trump was incorrect in claiming that Hunter received $1.5 billion, stating that Trump had no evidence to support the claim and that he incorrectly interpreted BHR's past fundraising target of $1.5 billion; BHR invested money raised from other companies and did not keep the funds. [ 33 ] Trump publicly called upon China to investigate Hunter Biden's business activities there while his father was vice president. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Hunter Biden announced his resignation from the board of directors of BHR Partners, effective the end of October 2019, citing "the barrage of false charges" by then-U.S. President Trump. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] This was confirmed by Biden's attorney, who said in November 2021 that his client no longer held any direct or indirect interest in BHR. [ 38 ] However, as of April 2020, Chinese business records showed that Hunter Biden remained a board member of BHR. [ 39 ] According to his lawyer, Biden had "not received any compensation for being on BHR's board of directors" nor had he received any return on his equity share in BHR. [ 40 ] Biden's lawyer George Mesires told The Washington Post that BHR Partners had been "capitalized from various sources with a total of 30 million RMB ( Renminbi ), or about $4.2 million, not $1.5 billion". [ 32 ] Biden's solely-owned company Skaneateles LLC owned a 10% equity stake in BHR as of December 2020. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] In November 2021, New York Times reported that "Chinese corporate records show Skaneateles remains a part owner of BHR". [ 38 ] Skaneateles was dissolved in 2022. BHR Partners invests Chinese venture capital into tech startups, such as an early-stage investment in Chinese auto hailing app DiDi [ 33 ] and cross-border acquisitions in automotive and mining, for example, the purchase of a stake in Democratic Republic of Congo copper and cobalt producer Tenke Fungurume Mining . [ 43 ] [ 44 ] The New York Times reported that BHR Partners helped finance a coal-mining company in Australia that was controlled by a Chinese state-owned enterprise , assisted a subsidiary of a Chinese defense company in acquiring an auto parts manufacturer in Michigan, and facilitated the $3.8 billion purchase of the DRC cobalt mine. A former BHR board member told the Times that Biden and the other American BHR founder, Devon Archer , were not involved in the mine deal. [ 38 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Burisma Holdings See also: Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory and Trump–Ukraine scandal In April 2014, Biden joined the board of Burisma Holdings owned by Ukrainian oligarch and former politician Mykola Zlochevsky , who was facing a money laundering investigation just after the Ukrainian revolution . [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] Biden's business partner, Devon Archer, had joined the board of Burisma several months prior. Biden was hired to help Burisma with requesting assistance from the U.S government to expand its business and corporate governance best practices , while still an attorney with Boies Schiller Flexner . A consulting firm in which Biden is a partner was also retained by Burisma. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Christopher Heinz, John Kerry 's stepson, opposed his partners Devon Archer and Hunter Biden joining the board in 2014 due to the reputational risk . [ 48 ] Biden served on the board of Burisma until his term expired in April 2019, [ 52 ] receiving compensation of up to $50,000 per month. [ 52 ] [ 51 ] Because Joe Biden played a major role in U.S. policy towards Ukraine, some Ukrainian anti-corruption advocates [ 54 ] [ 55 ] and Obama administration officials expressed concern that Hunter Biden having joined the board could create the appearance of a conflict of interest and undermine Joe Biden's anti-corruption work in Ukraine. [ 2 ] [ 48 ] While serving as vice president, Joe Biden joined other Western leaders in encouraging the government of Ukraine to fire the country's top prosecutor Viktor Shokin , [ 56 ] [ 57 ] who was widely criticized for blocking corruption investigations. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] The Ukrainian parliament voted to remove Shokin in March 2016. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] Biden lobbied the U.S. State Department on behalf of Burisma to help secure a potentially lucrative energy project in Italy while his father was still Vice President. In 2016, Biden wrote a letter to the U.S. ambassador to Italy, John R. Phillips , which Biden's lawyer described as seeking to arrange an introduction between Burisma and the president of Italy's Tuscany region, the location of a potential Burisma energy project. A businessman involved in Burisma's project said that the outreach was undertaken at a time when Burisma was having difficulty securing regulatory approval for its Tuscany project. Embassy officials who handled the letter were concerned about the son of the sitting vice president reaching out on behalf of a foreign company, and Biden's request for a meeting was ultimately unmet. As President, Joe Biden released records confirming Hunter Biden's lobbying effort after dropping out of his 2024 presidential campaign , and denied being aware of it while vice president. [ 50 ] [ 62 ] Since early 2019, Hunter and his father Joe Biden have been the subjects of false and baseless claims of corrupt activities in a Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory pushed by then-U.S. president Donald Trump and his allies. [ 63 ] Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani claimed in 2019, without evidence, that Joe Biden had sought the dismissal of Shokin in order to protect his son and Burisma Holdings. Actually, it was the official policy of the United States and the European Union to seek Shokin's removal. [ 64 ] [ 54 ] [ 56 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] There has also been no evidence produced of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden in Ukraine. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] The Ukrainian anti-corruption investigation agency stated in September 2019 that its current investigation of Burisma was restricted solely to investigating the period from 2010 to 2012, before Hunter Biden joined Burisma in 2014. [ 69 ] Shokin, in May 2019, claimed that he was fired because he had been actively investigating Burisma, [ 70 ] but U.S. and Ukrainian officials have stated that the investigation into Burisma was dormant at the time of Shokin's dismissal. [ 48 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ] Ukrainian and United States State Department sources note that Shokin was fired for failing to address corruption, including within his office. [ 65 ] [ 55 ] [ 72 ] In July 2019, Trump ordered the freezing of $391 million in military aid [ 73 ] shortly before a telephone conversation with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy in which Trump asked Zelenskyy to initiate an investigation of the Bidens. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] Trump falsely told Zelenskyy that "[Joe] Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution" of his son; Joe Biden did not stop any prosecution, did not brag about doing so, and there is no evidence his son was ever under investigation. [ 76 ] The United States House of Representatives initiated a formal impeachment inquiry on September 24, 2019, against Trump on the grounds that he may have sought to use U.S. foreign aid and the Ukrainian government to damage Joe Biden's 2020 presidential campaign . [ 77 ] Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko said in May 2019 that Hunter Biden had not violated Ukrainian law. After Lutsenko was replaced by Ruslan Riaboshapka as prosecutor general, Lutsenko and Riaboshapka said in September and October 2019 respectively that they had seen no evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. [ 56 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ] During 2019 and 2020, Republican senators Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley investigated Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma, as well as allegations that Democrats colluded with the Ukrainian government to interfere in the 2016 election. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee Republican senator Richard Burr privately expressed concerns to the senators that their inquiries could assist efforts by Russian intelligence to spread disinformation to disrupt American domestic affairs. [ 80 ] American intelligence officials briefed senators in late 2019 about Russian efforts to frame Ukraine for 2016 election interference. [ 81 ] Johnson said he would release findings in spring 2020, as Democrats would be selecting their 2020 presidential nominee, but instead ramped up the investigation at Trump's urging in May 2020, after it became clear that Joe Biden would be the nominee. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] Trump tweeted a press report about the investigations, later stating that he would make allegations of corruption by the Bidens a central theme of his re-election campaign. [ 81 ] Johnson decided in March 2020 against issuing a subpoena for former Ukrainian official Andrii Telizhenko, a Giuliani associate who had made appearances on the pro-Trump cable channel One America News , after the FBI briefed him about concerns Telizhenko could be spreading Russian disinformation. [ 84 ] The State Department revoked Telizhenko's visa in October 2020, and CNN reported the American government was considering sanctioning him as a Russian agent. [ 85 ] CNN reported that Vladislav Davidzon, the editor of Ukrainian magazine The Odessa Review , told CNN that in 2018 Telizhenko offered him money to lobby Republican senators in support of pro-Russian television stations in Ukraine. [ 86 ] When Johnson released the final report on the investigation, it contained no evidence that Joe Biden had pushed for Shokin's removal in order to benefit Hunter or Burisma. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] In June 2020, former Ukrainian prosecutor general Ruslan Riaboshapka stated that an audit of thousands of old case files he had ordered in October 2019 had found no wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. Riaboshapka was described by Zelenskyy as "100 percent my person" during the July 2019 call in which Trump asked him to investigate Biden. [ 89 ] Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Derkach , an associate of Rudy Giuliani with links to Russian intelligence, released in May 2020 alleged snippets of recordings of Joe Biden speaking with Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko during the years Hunter Biden worked for Burisma. [ 90 ] The recordings, which were not verified as authentic and appeared heavily edited, depicted Biden linking loan guarantees for Ukraine to the ouster of the country's prosecutor general. The recordings did not provide evidence to support the ongoing conspiracy theory that Biden wanted the prosecutor fired to protect his son. [ 91 ] Poroshenko denied in June 2020 that Joe Biden ever approached him about Burisma. [ 92 ] [ 93 ] The United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Derkach in September 2020, stating he "has been an active Russian agent for over a decade, maintaining close connections with the Russian Intelligence Services". The Treasury Department added Derkach "waged a covert influence campaign centered on cultivating false and unsubstantiated narratives concerning U.S. officials in the upcoming 2020 Presidential Election" including by the release of "edited audio tapes and other unsupported information with the intent to discredit U.S. officials". [ 94 ] [ 95 ] Close associates of Derkach were also sanctioned by the Treasury Department in January 2021. [ 96 ] United States intelligence community analysis released in March 2021 found that Derkach was among proxies of Russian intelligence who promoted and laundered misleading or unsubstantiated narratives about Biden "to US media organizations, US officials, and prominent US individuals, including some close to former President Trump and his administration". [ 97 ] [ 98 ] Two Republicans on a Senate investigation committee in 2020 claimed that Russian businessperson Yelena Baturina , the wife of former Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov , wire-transferred $3.5 million in 2014 to Rosemont Seneca Thornton, of which Biden had previously been a partner. The Washington Post reported in April 2022 that the partners of Rosemont Seneca Thornton had agreed to dissolve the organization before the 2014 wire transfer, though it continued to be operated by Devin Archer to facilitate real estate transactions for eastern and central Asia investors, while Biden was uninvolved. Archer received the $3.5 million wire from Baturina to purchase property in Brooklyn, New York . [ 22 ] The Senate report cited unspecified confidential documents and gave no evidence that Biden personally accepted the funds. [ 99 ] Biden's attorney denied the report, saying Biden had no financial relationship with Baturina and no stake in the partnership that received the money, nor did he co-found the partnership. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] However, Trump's White House spokeswoman Alyssa Farah repeated the claim, and in a press conference Trump repeatedly asserted that Biden received millions of dollars from the former mayor's wife. [ 99 ] Investigations and federal indictments Main article: Weiss special counsel investigation In December 2020, Biden made a public announcement via his attorney that his tax affairs were under federal criminal investigation. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] The New York Times and CNN described the investigation as having started in late 2018 and being related to potential violations of tax and money laundering laws and Biden's business dealings in foreign countries, principally China. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] The Wall Street Journal reported that Biden had provided legal and consulting services that generated foreign-earned income, citing a Senate Republicans' report that $4.79 million in wire transfers from entities linked to Chinese energy tycoon Ye Jianming and his company, CEFC China Energy , were paying for such services. [ 104 ] The New York Times reported that FBI investigators had been unable to establish sufficient evidence for a prosecution of potential money laundering crimes, including after the seizure of a laptop belonging to Biden, and so the investigation progressed onto tax issues. [ 105 ] [ 106 ] Since October 2021, Hollywood attorney and writer Kevin Morris , who has become an influential adviser/confidant and now financier to Biden, lent Biden more than $6.5 million to pay back taxes, support his family, and fund legal expenses. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] The New York Times reported in March 2022 that, since 2018, Biden and possibly others had been under investigation by federal prosecutors in Delaware, with a grand jury convened to subpoena and hear evidence. The investigation examined payments and gifts Biden or his associates had received from foreign interests and whether Biden had violated the law by not registering as a lobbyist under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). The Times reported it had acquired emails that were authenticated by people familiar with them and the investigation that appeared to come from a laptop belonging to Biden. One April 2014 email, written by Biden to his business partner as their work with Burisma was about to begin, noted that his father, then the vice president who would soon visit Kyiv , should "be characterized as part of our advice and thinking—but what he will say and do is out of our hands". The email also stated that Burisma officials "need to know in no uncertain terms that we will not and cannot intervene directly with domestic policymakers, and that we need to abide by FARA and any other U.S. laws in the strictest sense across the board". Biden wrote that his father's visit "could be a really good thing or it could end up creating too great an expectation. We need to temper expectations regarding that visit." He also wrote that his employer, the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, could help Burisma through "direct discussions at state , energy and NSC [ United States National Security Council ]". Other emails showed Biden and his business partner discussing inviting foreign business associates, including a Burisma executive, to attend an April 2015 dinner in Washington, where the vice president would stop by. [ 109 ] A July 2022 report from CNN authenticated emails which showed that Biden was struggling with large debt and overdue tax bills. [ 110 ] [ 111 ] In October 2022, The Washington Post reported that federal agents had determined months prior that they had assembled enough evidence for a viable criminal case against Biden to charge him with crimes related to making false declarations during a gun purchase, as well as tax-related crimes. The next step was for Delaware U.S. attorney David C. Weiss , a holdover from the Trump administration, [ 112 ] to decide on whether to file such charges. [ 113 ] Federal investigators had also been examining the lobbying firm Blue Star Strategies, which Burisma retained while Biden sat on its board, for possible illegal lobbying of American officials. There was no indication Biden was a subject of the investigation. Blue Star employees said in Senate testimony that Biden was included in emails about the firm's work but that he was not particularly involved. One of the firm's co-founders said Biden did not direct its work. Blue Star's work came after Burisma's owner was criticized by the United States State Department, and the firm's founders testified the firm had merely approached officials to determine the government's views of Burisma. [ 114 ] [ 115 ] On June 20, 2023, in a deal with prosecutors, Biden agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges of failure to pay income tax, and to enter a pretrial diversion program related to a felony gun charge of unlawful possession of a firearm. [ 116 ] [ 117 ] [ 118 ] Prosecutors recommended two years of probation for the tax charges; the gun charge would be dropped at the end of this period if the conditions of the diversion program had been met successfully. [ 112 ] Having the gun charge dropped was conditional on Biden remaining drug-free and never being allowed to own a firearm again. [ 119 ] Biden's attorney said the agreement with prosecutors "resolved" the investigation, though the Justice Department said the investigation was "ongoing". In court on July 26, 2023, federal prosecutors explained that the "ongoing" aspect of the investigation referred to possible charges under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA); FARA requires that anyone who acts on the behalf of a foreign government, e.g. China or Ukraine, must register with the Department of Justice and file regular reports on their activities for that government. [ 120 ] On July 26, the plea deal was rejected by the presiding judge, who cited concerns over immunity Biden might receive from future charges, and gave 30 days to both the government prosecutors and Biden's defense team to provide additional information. [ 119 ] Biden changed his plea from "guilty" to "not guilty". [ 121 ] [ 122 ] On August 8, Weiss requested appointment as a special counsel in the Biden investigation, which attorney general Merrick Garland granted. Garland announced the appointment on August 11, the same day Weiss announced government and Biden attorneys could not reach agreement on a new plea deal. [ 123 ] [ 124 ] The Justice Department said on September 6 that Weiss would ask a grand jury to return an indictment of Biden on a gun charge by September 29. [ 125 ] On September 14, Biden was officially indicted in Delaware on three federal firearms-related charges: two for making false statements on a firearm application form and one for prohibited possession of a firearm. [ 126 ] He was arraigned on October 3 and pleaded not guilty to all charges. [ 127 ] Legal experts noted that prosecutions for these charges are rare. [ 128 ] [ 129 ] In January 2024, prosecutors urged a judge to not dismiss Biden's gun charge, revealing that cocaine residue was found in his gun pouch. [ 130 ] On December 7, 2023, Biden was indicted in California on nine tax charges, including three felony and six misdemeanor offenses. The indictment reads that "The Defendant engaged in a four-year scheme to not pay at least $1.4 million in self-assessed federal taxes he owed for tax years 2016 through 2019." Biden's lawyer said that Biden had repaid his taxes in full prior to the indictment. [ 131 ] [ 132 ] On January 11, 2024, Biden pleaded not guilty to the tax charges. [ 133 ] [ 134 ] The same day, U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi scheduled the trial for June 20, 2024. [ 135 ] [ 134 ] The trial was later delayed to September 5, 2024, due to the "needs of the defendant" in preparing for his Delaware trial on firearms charges in June. [ 136 ] Biden repeatedly sought to dismiss both tax and gun charges against him, without success. [ 137 ] [ 138 ] In August 2024, prosecutors alleged that Biden agreed to lobby on behalf of a Romanian businessman seeking to "influence U.S. government agencies" while his father was vice president. The businessman, Gabriel Popoviciu, was under criminal investigation in Romania at the time and hired Biden to assist in fighting his criminal charges through the US government. Prosecutors sought to introduce evidence from Biden's work with Popoviciu as part of his charges on tax evasion. [ 139 ] [ 140 ] A pre-trial hearing for the tax indictment which involved Biden's lawyers would be held on August 21, 2024. [ 141 ] Firearms trial and convictions A final pre-trial hearing for the gun charges was held on May 24, 2024. [ 142 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ] During the final hearing, Judge Maryellen Noreika ruled that prosecutors could not refer to his upcoming California tax trial, child support proceedings in Arkansas, his discharge from the Navy, or include statements which Biden made at a July 2023 hearing where his plea deal collapsed. [ 143 ] However, the prosecution was permitted to bring up Biden's drug use, portions of his memoir, and a summary of data from his laptop, phone, and iPad . [ 143 ] [ 145 ] Biden's trial began on June 3, 2024, on charges of unlawfully possessing a gun as a drug user, lying on a federal form when he bought the gun, and making a false statement about information required to be collected by a federally licensed gun dealer. The charges stemmed from a gun purchased and possessed by Biden in October 2018. During the trial, three of Biden's former partners testified regarding Biden's drug usage and gun purchase. [ 145 ] On June 11, Biden was found guilty on three felony charges for federal gun violations. [ 146 ] [ 147 ] The conviction made Biden the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be convicted in a criminal trial. [ 148 ] Due to his conviction on felony charges, Biden's license to practice law in Washington, D.C. was suspended. [ 149 ] Biden was scheduled to be sentenced on December 12, 2024, which did not occur due to him being pardoned by his father on December 1. [ 150 ] Tax indictment and guilty pleas On September 5, 2024, Biden's defense lawyer Abbe Lowell revealed that Biden would change his plea from not guilty to guilty in the federal tax case. [ 151 ] Biden had been indicted with three felony charges– one tax evasion count and two counts of filing false returns – and six misdemeanor charges. [ 152 ] It was not immediately clear if the presiding Judge Mark C. Scarsi would accept this plea proposal, which would be regarded as an Alford plea . [ 153 ] Under this proposed plea agreement, Biden would have accepted both a sentence and the strength of evidence against him, but also maintained his innocence. [ 154 ] [ 153 ] Later in the day, it was reported that this plea offer would not be accepted by the prosecution. [ 155 ] Initially, Judge Scarsi would neither accept the initial plea offer or call off the trial, but also did not make a final ruling and would opt to make a decision about the plea offer at a later time. [ 154 ] [ 156 ] Prosecutors said they would reject an Alford plea. [ 157 ] However, Scarsi would accept a guilty plea by the end of the day, with Biden pleading guilty to all nine charges. [ 158 ] During his plea hearing, Biden responded "Yes" after Scarsi asked him "Do you agree you committed every element of the charges in the indictment?" [ 158 ] Biden was scheduled to be sentenced on December 16, 2024 and he could have faced up to 17 years in prison. Former federal prosecutor, Tom Dupree, told CBS News he expected the judge to impose a sentence of fewer than five years. President Biden, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, First Lady Jill Biden, and White House spokesperson Andrew Bates repeatedly stated that the president would decline to pardon Hunter or commute his sentence. [ 158 ] [ 150 ] Pardon of criminal offenses Pardon dated December 1, 2024 On December 1, 2024, President Biden issued a full and unconditional pardon for his son. The pardon covered all federal offenses committed between January 1, 2014, and December 1, 2024, and included his tax charges, gun charges, and any other potential charges within that time. In an official White House statement from President Biden, he said that he believed his son was "selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted", and blamed political pressure for the failure of a plea deal for Hunter. [ 159 ] [ 160 ] He concluded by saying "I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision." The New York Times reported that the plea deal fell apart due to the presiding judge questioning its unusual construction, which violated a basic tenet of federal guilty pleas against having side deals in the plea agreement. [ 161 ] In court filings subsequent to the pardon, special counsel Weiss stated "there was none and never has been any evidence of vindictive or selective prosecution in this case". [ 162 ] Judge Scarsi stated that President Biden's characterizations "stand in tension with the case record" and that the Constitution does not "give the president the authority to rewrite history[.]" [ 163 ] The scope of the pardon was unusually broad and legal experts could recall only Richard Nixon as someone given similar terms for a pardon , for a term between 1969 and 1974. [ 164 ] [ 165 ] [ 150 ] The breadth of the pardon includes Hunter Biden's "entire tenure on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, as well as much of his other international work, including in China." [ 166 ] The pardon received bipartisan criticism from members of Congress as harming the justice system. [ 167 ] [ 168 ] In the months leading up to Hunter's scheduled sentencing, the President had made repeated statements that he would not use the pardon authority for his own son. He and his staff continued to state that there would be no pardon for Hunter as late as November, although internal staff discussions affirmed that the option for a pardon would remain on the table even as Biden publicly stated otherwise. [ 169 ] [ 150 ] Hunter issued the following statement in response to the pardon: I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction – mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport, I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering. [ 170 ] Laptop files Main article: Hunter Biden laptop controversy Hunter with his sister Ashley , at their father's inauguration, January 2021. Discovery of Hunter Biden's laptop was an October surprise prior to the 2020 election. [ 171 ] On October 14, 2020, twenty days prior to the 2020 United States presidential election , the New York Post published an article based on content provided to the publication by Donald Trump 's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and former chief strategist Steve Bannon . The article concerned what the Post said was a laptop computer that had belonged to Hunter Biden and that was allegedly left for repairs at a Wilmington, Delaware , computer shop. According to the narrative in the Post article, this device contained an email that referenced a "meeting" between Joe Biden and Vadym Pozharskyi, a Burisma advisor. [ 172 ] The article's veracity was strongly questioned at the time by many mainstream media outlets as well as dozens of current and former intelligence officials for possibly being a Russian disinformation campaign. [ 173 ] [ 174 ] (As of March 25, 2022, Vox reported that there was no evidence to corroborate the intelligence officials' suspicions that the laptop leak was part of a "Russian plot". [ 171 ] ) In January 2024, federal prosecutors stated that they had possession of a laptop computer which Hunter Biden left at the computer store and confirmed that the device contained files also found in cloud backups to Biden's Apple account. [ 175 ] In June 2024, the laptop and its contents were utilized as evidence during a federal court trial of Hunter Biden for firearms charges. FBI investigators testified at the trial, confirming the authenticity of the laptop, and stating that they had cross-referencing texts, emails, and messages found on the laptop with Apple and had verified the serial number on the laptop. Prosecutors also introduced the invoice from the repair shop as evidence. [ 176 ] [ 177 ] Biden was deposed by the House Judiciary and Oversight committees on February 28, 2024, which discussed emails found on the laptop. Biden stated during the deposition that he did not recall sending the laptop for repairs. [ 178 ] [ 179 ] In February 2023, Hunter Biden's attorneys wrote to the Justice Department National Security Division asking that they criminally investigate "individuals for whom there is considerable reason to believe violated various federal laws in accessing, copying, manipulating, and/or disseminating Mr. Biden's personal computer data". A similar letter was sent to the Attorney General of Delaware . The letters named Giuliani, Bannon, Mac Isaac (owner of the Wilmington computer repair shop where the laptop was abandoned), and others. [ 180 ] [ 181 ] The special counsel assigned to the case later described Hunter Biden's claim of right-wing bias as "fiction designed for a Hollywood script". [ 175 ] Another event resulting from discovery of the laptop occurred in January 2023: an anonymous Twitter account posted a rental application found on the laptop, leading to a false claim that in 2018 Hunter Biden had paid rent while residing at his father's Delaware home, where classified documents had been found . James Comer , chair of the House Oversight Committee that was investigating the Biden family , inquired whether it was evidence that Hunter Biden illicitly provided money from his foreign business activities to his father. The document was determined to be a quarterly rental payment for office space at the House of Sweden in Washington, D.C. [ 182 ] Navy Reserve Biden's application for a position in the U.S. Navy Reserve was approved in May 2013. [ 183 ] At age 43, Biden was accepted as part of a program that allows a limited number of applicants with desirable skills to receive commissions and serve in staff positions. [ 184 ] Biden received an age-related waiver and a waiver for a past drug-related incident; he was sworn in as a direct commission officer by his father in a White House ceremony. [ 183 ] [ 2 ] Results of a routine urinalysis taken on Biden's first weekend of reserve duty revealed cocaine in his system. [ 2 ] [ 184 ] He was discharged administratively in February 2014. [ 184 ] [ 185 ] Biden attributed the result to having smoked a cigarette that he had asked a group of men outside a store to give him, claiming the cigarette contained cocaine as well as tobacco. [ 2 ] He did not appeal the discharge, stating that he thought it unlikely the panel would believe his explanation given his history of drug addiction. [ 186 ] [ 2 ] Biden also stated that he did not appeal due to the likelihood that this would result in the press becoming aware of the discharge; however, it was eventually disclosed to The Wall Street Journal by a Navy official. [ 2 ] [ 183 ] Work as an artist In February 2020, The New York Times reported that Biden had been painting as an "undiscovered artist" in his Hollywood Hills home. The report also displayed some of his paintings, including "Untitled #4 (a study in ink)" and "Untitled #3 (a signed work)". [ 187 ] Biden's art dealer, Georges Bergès, hosted a private viewing for Biden in Los Angeles in fall 2021, followed by an exhibition in New York. [ 188 ] Biden's paintings were put up for sale for as much as $500,000 per painting, with Kevin Morris purchasing $875,000 worth of his art. [ 189 ] Another buyer was Elizabeth Hirsh Naftali, a prominent California Democratic Party donor who was appointed to the U.S. Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad by Joe Biden. Business Insider was unable to verify how much Hirsh Naftali spent on the art, nor whether the purchase occurred before or after her appointment. An ethicist interviewed by the news website said that the purchase was ethically problematic, particularly if it occurred before her appointment, as "it might be perceived as a quid pro quo ." [ 190 ] The purchases provoked concerns about possible conflicts of interest and a lack of transparency. [ 191 ] [ 192 ] According to court filings by Biden, between December 2021 and December 2023, he sold approximately $1.5 million of his art. [ 193 ] From December 2023 to March 2025, he sold $36,000 of art. [ 193 ] Presidency of Joe Biden During his father's presidency, Hunter emerged as one of six key individuals who insulated Joe from scrutiny and acted as an intermediary between him and others. [ 194 ] After a poor presidential debate performance by Joe in June 2024 caused intensified public concern about his age and fitness for the presidency, Hunter helped Joe with speech preparation and began joining meetings with the president and his staffers. [ 195 ] Hunter maintained daily, often hourly contact with his father on calls. Joe increasingly relied on Hunter for advice, and Hunter emerged as one of the strongest voices in Joe's circle urging him not to drop out of his reelection campaign . [ 196 ] [ 197 ] [ 198 ] [ 199 ] Hunter had been a regular presence in public White House events, but his increased involvement in Biden's presidency and campaign led to surprise and concern from White House staffers. After Joe's poor debate performance, Hunter advocated for Joe to fire some of his top staffers, including Anita Dunn and Bob Bauer . Hunter also began acting as a "de facto gatekeeper" for access to the president. [ 197 ] [ 199 ] [ 200 ] Litigation Between 2023 and 2024, Hunter privately sued numerous individuals, organizations, and the U.S. Government alleging various instances of invasion of privacy and defamation. In September 2023, Biden filed suit against the IRS , claiming unlawful disclosures of his tax return information in relation to two IRS employees who provided information to members of Congress. [ 201 ] The D.C. District Court dismissed his claim under the Privacy Act in September 2024, and Biden dropped the suit altogether in 2025. [ 202 ] In 2023, Biden sued Garrett Ziegler 's Marco Polo organization, accusing the group of invasion of privacy for publishing 128,000 of his emails that were recovered from his lost laptop computer. [ 203 ] In March 2025, Biden sought to have the case dismissed due to his worsening personal financial situation and inability to continue to pay for his own legal representation. [ 203 ] In 2024, Biden sued Rudy Giuliani alleging Giuliani was responsible for the "total annihilation" of his privacy due to his involvement in releasing data from his laptop computer. [ 204 ] He dropped the lawsuit shortly thereafter. [ 204 ] The same year, he sued Fox News for airing images taken from the laptop, but dropped the lawsuit without explanation the following month. [ 205 ] Three months later, however, he resurrected the lawsuit in state court. [ 206 ] In a statement, Fox News described the second lawsuit as "devoid of any merit". [ 206 ] Later life Following the presidency of Joe Biden, according to The Daily Beast , Hunter fell "on hard times". [ 207 ] The prior year — in 2024 — his law license had been suspended, NBC News noting at the time that it was unclear what impact the suspension would have on his livelihood. [ 208 ] In January 2025, his rental home was damaged and left uninhabitable during the Palisades Fire and he had difficulty finding new housing, resulting in him experiencing homelessness. By this point, he was several million dollars in debt and his income severely impacted by flagging interest in his memoir, which was selling less than 200 copies per month. In court filings, Biden averred that he had anticipated earning money from invitations for paid speaking engagements, but no such invitations had materialized. [ 207 ] [ 209 ] In March 2025, Hunter's Secret Service detail was withdrawn on the direction of Donald Trump. Prior to the end of his term, Joe Biden had ordered an extended period of post-presidency protection for Hunter. [ 210 ] Personal life Relationships Biden (center) with family at his brother Beau's funeral in June 2015 In 1993, Biden married Kathleen Buhle . [ 2 ] They have three daughters: Naomi (named after Biden's sister), [ 211 ] Finnegan, and Maisey. [ 10 ] The couple formally separated in October 2015, and divorced in 2017. [ 212 ] [ 213 ] Buhle's 2022 memoir If We Break documents her account of the relationship. [ 214 ] Biden began a relationship with his brother's widow Hallie Olivere Biden in 2016. [ 215 ] [ 2 ] The relationship ended in 2019. [ 2 ] [ 216 ] [ 217 ] Between 2017 and 2018, Biden also had a romantic relationship with Zoë Kestan . [ 217 ] Biden has a fourth daughter, born in August 2018 in Arkansas , to Lunden Alexis Roberts. [ 218 ] [ 219 ] Biden initially denied that the child was his, but a DNA test , conducted as part of a paternity suit filed in May 2019 by Roberts, confirmed he is the father. The lawsuit was settled in March 2020 after Biden agreed to pay Roberts $20,000 a month in child support. [ 220 ] [ 221 ] Biden filed a motion in September 2022 to reduce his child support payments, on the basis of reduced income; Roberts opposed this request and also petitioned the Arkansas court to change the child's surname to Biden, so that his daughter might benefit from associations with Biden's family. [ 222 ] In June 2023, Biden and Roberts settled the dispute. As part of the settlement, Biden agreed to give several of his paintings to his daughter and pay an undisclosed monthly amount in child support until the daughter turns 18. Biden also agreed to assist with college tuition. Roberts agreed to drop her petition to change their daughter's surname. [ 223 ] [ 224 ] [ 225 ] The matter received significant attention in the media. [ 226 ] Biden married South African filmmaker Melissa Cohen in May 2019, within a week of first meeting her. [ 186 ] [ 227 ] Their son, named Beau in honor of Biden's brother, was born in March 2020 in Los Angeles.

"He really had no substantial Ukraine experience, no Ukraine experience, and no substantial experience in the energy sector at that stage in his career," Entous said. "So, you know, the suspicion was among people who worked for Joe Biden and some State Department and White House officials was this was an effort on the part of Burisma to curry favor." Entous also said the perceived conflict of interest over Hunter Biden's connection to the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma while his father served as vice president is "a legitimate subject of scrutiny." "There's (sic) two separate issues here," Entous said. "The issue of whether it was wise of Hunter Biden to take this position at Burisma when his father was guiding policy in Ukraine and, you know, the wisdom of Biden staffers, once they knew that, not to ask Hunter to step down." "I think that's a legitimate subject of scrutiny." Entous said the other issue is whether Joe Biden used his office as vice president to pressure the Ukrainian government into firing a prosecutor who was looking into Burisma. House Democrats have opened an impeachment inquiry into President Trump over a phone conversation in which he appears to have asked the Ukrainian president to open an investigation into Biden's conduct in Ukraine and his role in the prosecutor's dismissal. The reporter said he had looked into the issue but had "found no evidence to back up and a lot of evidence to the contrary." Over the summer, Entous wrote an extensive profile of Hunter Biden's troubles and how they could affect his father's presidential campaign. In the profile, Hunter said he discussed his position on the board of the Ukrainian gas company once with his father: In December, 2015, as Joe Biden prepared to return to Ukraine, his aides braced for renewed scrutiny of Hunter’s relationship with Burisma. Amos Hochstein, the Obama Administration’s special envoy for energy policy, raised the matter with Biden, but did not go so far as to recommend that Hunter leave the board. As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: "Dad said, ‘I hope you know what you are doing,’ and I said, ‘I do.’" The New York Times reported that Biden's campaign is pushing back aggressively against claims of misconduct. During an encounter with a reporter who asked Biden about his son, the former vice president forcefully told the reporter to "ask the right questions."

While framed by the president as addressing Hunter’s gun and tax charges, the pardon stunningly covers all crimes Hunter “committed or may have committed” from 2014 to 2023, a period covering Hunter’s questionable business dealings in Ukraine, China, and other foreign nations. In 2014, Hunter began receiving $1 million annually from Burisma, a company controlled by a Ukrainian oligarch which dealt in energy holdings, an industry with which Hunter had no relevant experience. Also, in February 2014, then-Vice-President Joe Biden dined with Russian and Kazakhstani oligarchs who were shortly thereafter responsible for millions of dollars in suspect money transfers including $142,300 which appears to have covered the cost of a car for Hunter. Rather than supporting the integrity of the legal system, by issuing this pardon, President Biden did the opposite and instead decided to put family above fairness to American taxpayers and law-abiding citizens. This is an unacceptable abuse of presidential powers. It has been said, “eternal vigilance is the price of liberty," and after the historic inflation, regulatory overreach, and failures of leadership we’ve seen throughout the Biden-Harris administration, it is clear reining in the excesses of the federal government has never been more urgent. As Republicans look forward to advancing sound policy for the American people in the coming year, we are preparing to deliver government accountability to the taxpayers, families, and small businesses which make up the backbone of our economy. This week, the office of Sen. Joni Ernst released a report showing only 6 percent of the more than two million federal employees work completely in-person rather than telework or remote work. Meanwhile, leasing, maintenance, and operations for federal office buildings costs taxpayers approximately $15.7 billion annually. This is the reason I supported the SHOW UP Act in 2023 to require federal agency employees to show up for work and get back to the business of serving the American people. Unfortunately, the bill has been ignored by Democrats in the Senate and White House. I am eager to ensure the government works more efficiently for the American people and welcome the opportunity to work toward this goal with Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and President Trump’s newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) which aims to address wasteful federal spending and bureaucratic bloat in the coming year. The IRS will be a good place for DOGE’s work to start. Overhauling the IRS requires new leadership. I applaud President Trump’s announcement of his plan to remove the current Commissioner Danny Werfel and nominate my former colleague, Billy Long to fill the role. Despite his commitments to “world-class customer service” and “to roll up [his] sleeves to help working families” during his confirmation process, Commissioner Werfel’s tenure at the IRS has instead focused on advancing the Biden-Harris agenda to intrude further into the financial privacy of American families and small businesses. We need an IRS commissioner who will restore accountability to the agency and its employees, ensure unelected bureaucrats do not harass Americans on the basis of ideology as it did under the Obama administration, simplify tax compliance, protect taxpayer data and privacy, update antiquated technology systems, return to wholly appropriated funding, end the unlawful Direct File Program, and have a true focus on serving taxpayers well. I hope Rep. Long will demonstrate his capacity to do this as the Senate considers his nomination. To combat inflation caused by overspending, clean up the morass of overregulation, and hold those entrusted with power accountable, we need to refocus and repair how the federal government serves Americans. In many ways this looks like getting Washington out of the way and allowing the American people do what they do best. President Ronald Reagan famously said, “the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government, and I'm here to help.” It’s about time we restore accountability and focus on efficiency governmentwide. ### Issues : Economy Taxes Office Locations Washington DC Office 502 Cannon HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-6435 Fax: (202) 225-0207 Nebraska City District Office 202 South 8th Street Suite A Nebraska City, NE 68410 Phone: (402) 874-6050 Fax: (402) 874-6049 Grand Island District Office 1811 West Second Street Suite 275 Grand Island, NE 68803 Phone: (308) 384-3900 Fax: (308) 384-3902 Scottsbluff District Office 416 Valley View Dr. Suite 600 Scottsbluff, NE 69361 Phone: (308) 633-6333 Fax: (308) 633-6335 Copyright Privacy House.gov Accessibility RSS

During the 2020 election campaign, he and his father were frequently accused by Donald Trump and his associates of wrongdoing in regards to China and Ukraine, allegations which they both denied. The New York Post reported on an alleged email in which an adviser from a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, apparently thanked Hunter for inviting him to meet his father, Joe Biden. Asked about the allegations, Joe Biden told a reporter it was a "smear campaign". No criminal activity has been proven, and no evidence has emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. In an interview with the BBC months after his father was sworn in as president, Hunter Biden defended his qualifications for the position at Burisma but added that, in retrospect, he had "missed... the perception that I would create". Claims of influence-peddling are common in Washington DC and Mr Trump's children have also been accused of conflicts of interest in lucrative business deals overseas. They, too, deny wrongdoing. What do we know about the federal investigation? The Justice Department is investigating Hunter Biden's finances including scrutinising some of his past Chinese business dealings and other transactions, a "person familiar with the matter" told The Associated Press in December . The tax investigation was launched in 2018 but Hunter Biden said he had learned about it for the first time in December 2020. Asked about the investigation by US broadcaster CBS this April, the president's son said: "I'm co-operating, completely. And I'm absolutely certain, 100% certain, that at the end of the investigation, that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing." What have the Bidens been accused of in China? The New York Post cited a purported email from Hunter Biden in August 2017 indicating he was receiving a $10m annual fee from a Chinese billionaire for "introductions alone", though it is unclear who was involved in the alleged introductions. Another purported email, which Fox News said it had confirmed, reportedly refers to a deal pursued by Hunter involving China's largest private energy firm. It is said to include a cryptic mention of "10 held by H for the big guy". Fox News cited unnamed sources as saying "the big guy" in the purported email was a reference to Joe Biden. This message is said to be from May 2017. Both emails would date from when the former US vice-president was a private citizen. A former business associate of Hunter Biden has come forward to say he can confirm the allegations. Tony Bobulinski told Fox News that, contrary to Joe Biden's statements that he had nothing to do with his son's business affairs, Hunter had "frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals" in China. Mr Bobulinski, who is reportedly a US Navy veteran, separately told Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he had met on two occasions with Joe Biden to discuss business deals with China, the first time in May 2017 when Barack Obama's former vice-president was a private citizen. He says he asked Joe Biden's brother, James, whether the family was concerned about possible scrutiny of the former vice-president's involvement in a potential business deal with a Chinese entity. Mr Bobulinski told Fox News that James Biden had replied: "Plausible deniability." Mr Bobulinski was invited by Mr Trump to be his guest at the final presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee on 22 October. What is known about Hunter's dealings in China? In 2013, Hunter flew aboard Air Force Two with his father, who was then vice-president, on an official visit to Beijing, where the younger Biden met investment banker Jonathan Li. Hunter told the New Yorker he had just met Mr Li for "a cup of coffee", but 12 days after the trip a private equity fund, BHR Partners, was approved by the Chinese authorities. Mr Li was chief executive and Hunter was a board member. He would hold a 10% stake. Getty Images Joe Biden walks out of Air Force Two with his granddaughter and son, Hunter Biden BHR is backed by some of China's largest state banks and by local governments, according to US media. Hunter Biden's lawyer said he had joined the board in an unpaid position "based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets". His lawyer also said his client did not acquire his financial stake in BHR until 2017, after his father had left office in the US. Hunter resigned from the board of BHR in April 2020, but still held his 10% stake in BHR as of July this year, according to the company report. What did the New York Post say about Hunter Biden and Ukraine? The New York Post reported an email from April 2015, in which an adviser to Burisma, Vadym Pozharskyi, apparently thanked Hunter Biden for inviting him to meet his father in Washington. Hunter was a director on the board of Burisma - a Ukrainian-owned private energy company while his father was the Obama administration's pointman on US-Ukrainian relations. Hunter was one of several foreigners on its board. The New York Post article did not provide evidence that the meeting had ever taken place. The Biden election campaign said there was no record of any such meeting on the former vice-president's "official schedule" from the time. But in a statement to Politico , the campaign also acknowledged that Mr Biden could have had an "informal interaction" with the Burisma adviser that did not appear on his official schedule, though it said any such encounter would have been "cursory". "Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague, have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official US policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing," said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr Biden. What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Biden's team has also decried the New York Post story as "Russian disinformation", though it did not say the emails were bogus. The New York Post article was shared by President Trump and his allies. Two of his former advisers, Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani, were involved in providing the story and the hard drive containing the alleged emails, to the newspaper. Mr Giuliani says the messages were found on a laptop that Hunter dropped off at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. Sceptics have noted that Mr Giuliani travelled in December 2019 to Kyiv where he met Ukrainian lawmaker Andriy Derkach, whom the US Treasury has designated as a longtime Kremlin agent. Mr Giuliani has acknowledged trying dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine. But the US Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, told Fox Business that the purported emails were not connected to a Russian disinformation effort. Other US media say they have been unable to verify the authenticity of the emails. Hunter has neither confirmed nor denied that he dropped off a laptop at the location. Hunter joined Burisma in 2014, and remained on the board until April 2019, when he decided to leave. Speaking to the BBC, he said Burisma had seen his name "as gold" and that it had played a large part in his appointment to the board. Twitter and Facebook's action over Joe Biden article reignites bias claims What are the Bidens accused of in Ukraine? Donald Trump and his allies accused Joe Biden of wrongdoing because he had pushed, while vice-president, for the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, who was investigating the company for which Hunter worked. In 2016, Joe Biden called for the dismissal of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin, whose office had Burisma and other companies under investigation. However, other Western leaders and major bodies that give financial support to Ukraine also wanted the prosecutor dismissed because they believed he was not active enough in tackling corruption. What else has the Biden campaign said? Shortly before the final presidential debate last year, the Democrat's camp released a statement denying wrongdoing. "Joe Biden has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever," said the statement. "He has never held stock in any such business arrangements nor has any family member or any other person ever held stock for him. "What is true is that Tony Bobulinski admitted on the record to Breitbart that he is angry that he was *not* able to go into business with Hunter and James Biden [Joe Biden's brother]." What did this have to do with impeachment? In 2019, details emerged of a phone call Mr Trump, the then president, had made to the president of Ukraine, in which he had urged the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens. President Trump's impeachment explained This led to charges by the Democrats that Mr Trump was trying to illegally pressure Ukraine to help damage his election rival, resulting in impeachment by the House of Representatives. Mr Trump denied he had done anything wrong, and he was later acquitted by the Republican-controlled US Senate. Getty Images President Trump holds a copy of The Washington Post the day after the US Senate acquitted him on two articles of impeachment Has anything been proven against the Bidens? While no criminal activity has been proven, it has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. A senior State Department official raised such concerns as far back as 2015. Joe Biden's son defends foreign dealings US Republican lawmakers launched an investigation and found last year that Hunter's work for the Ukrainian firm had been "problematic" - but there wasn't evidence that US foreign policy was influenced by it. No criminal charges were proven against Burisma either. The company issued a statement in 2017 saying "all legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations" against it were closed. Last year, Yuriy Lutsenko, the prosecutor in Ukraine who succeeded Viktor Shokin, told the BBC that there was no reason to investigate the Bidens under Ukrainian law. There is nothing illegal about sitting on a board of a company whilst family members serve in government. Hunter Biden's lawyers said in statement in October 2019 that he had undertaken "these business activities independently. He did not believe it appropriate to discuss them with his father, nor did he." Hunter told the New Yorker magazine that on the only occasion he had mentioned Burisma: "Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing.'" Amid all the scrutiny, Joe Biden promised last year that if he was elected president, no-one in his family would hold a job or have a business relationship with a foreign corporation or foreign government.

Trump (1st Term) 45th President of the United States: 2017 ‐ 2021 Trump Campaign Press Release - FACT: Shady Foreign Sources Threw Money At Deadbeat Hunter Biden While His Father Was Vice President September 29, 2020 Joe Biden and his family are stone cold corrupt. For decades, career politicians like Joe Biden have used their positions and power to enrich themselves and their family members at the expense of working-class Americans. A vote for Joe Biden is a vote to return to the failed, corrupt status quo. While Biden was vice president, his son Hunter jetted around the world with him, cashing in on shady business deals with Ukrainian, Russian, and Chinese nationals. Why did so many foreign sources throw so much money at a deadbeat like Hunter? Russian billionaire Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow, sent a $3.5 million wire transfer to Hunter Biden's company on Valentine's Day in 2014. Despite having zero experience in the energy sector, Hunter Biden and his firm were paid millions of dollars by a corrupt Ukrainian gas company for a no-show job while his father was in charge of America's foreign policy on Ukraine. Hunter landed the sweetheart gig within weeks of his father's visit to Ukraine. In 2013, Hunter hitched a ride on Air Force Two with Joe Biden to China. While in Beijing, the vice president met with his son's Chinese business partner. 10 days after this trip, Hunter's firm inked a deal with the Chinese government that was potentially worth $1.5 billion. Hunter Biden still has a 10% stake in the Chinese equity firm BHR Partners, which has invested in facial recognition technology used by the Chinese regime to surveil its Muslim population. A Chinese oil tycoon began courting Hunter Biden in 2015 and gave him a 2.8 carat diamond. Hunter opened a joint bank account with a Chinese national tied to the Communist government. The account financed a $100,000 global spending spree for Hunter as well as Joe Biden's brother James and his wife Sara. Donald J.

At the same time those meetings occurred, Archer was negotiating Hunter Biden’s position on the board of directors of Burisma – a Ukrainian company – whose executives implied his value to their company was his influence with his father. They even acknowledged the sensitive optics surrounding his appointment to the company’s board, and discussed the need to make his appointment public only after then-Vice President Biden’s first official trip to Ukraine concluded. April 15, 2014: Devon Archer meets with Vice President Biden at the White House. April 16, 2014: Hunter Biden has coffee with Greg Schultz, Senior Advisor to Vice President Biden. Later that same day, Hunter Biden meets with Devon Archer at the White House. April 17, 2014: A Burisma executive emails Devon Archer stating, as it relates to Hunter Biden, “ I do believe we have to reach a reasonable balance here ” and acknowledged they were relying on Hunter Biden’s influence with his father and would take into account how to use “ the political weight of our Directors… carefully and strategically. ” The email went on to say they would list Hunter Biden on their website “ after his father left our country” and underlined how Burisma could not, “hide our directors. ” April 21, 2014: Then-Vice President Joe Biden travels to Ukraine. May 12, 2014 : Hunter Biden appointed to Burisma’s board of directors. May 13, 2014: According to emails obtained from the Hunter Biden laptop, Eric Schwerin, another Hunter Biden business associate, directed a photo of Joe Biden and Devon Archer that was taken at the April 15th White House meeting be removed from Burisma’s website at the request of the Vice President’s General Counsel. June 7, 2014: Then-Vice President Joe Biden travels to Ukraine for a second time to attend the inauguration of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. September 24, 2014: Devon Archer forwards an email to Hunter Biden discussing the need to “alert U.S. officials who might be able to influence Ukraine to not adopt such harmful measures.” October 27, 2014: Hunter Biden receives an email from a U.S. government official stating, “Secretary of State may be calling you soon.” November 20, 2014: Then-Vice President Biden visits Ukraine for a third time. December 17, 2014: Eric Schwerin emails Hunter Biden to request then-Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s email address. Chairman Smith said, “It is hard to believe the timing of Hunter Biden’s appointment to the board of Burisma and his father’s multiple official visits to Ukraine are mere coincidence. House Republicans are determined to get to the bottom of the Biden family’s influence peddling scheme, and the American people have a right to know if then-Vice President Biden used his official government position to help his family’s overseas business operations. “Thanks to the IRS whistleblowers we know President Biden lied when he said he had no knowledge and was not involved in his son’s business dealings. It now appears he in fact benefited. We will continue to follow the facts in this investigation and present the truth to the American people.” READ : Bombshell: Ways and Means Releases New Documents Revealing Hunter Biden Selling Access to White House, Investigators Blocked from Pursuing Evidence Related to President Biden READ : ICYMI: Documents Confirm Joe Biden was his Family’s “Only Asset” and “The Brand” READ : ICYMI: New Documents Link Biden Family Influence Peddling Scheme to 23 Countries, Four Continents READ : ICYMI: Hunter Biden’s Business Associates Enjoyed White House Dinners, Flights on Air Force 2 Internships Minority Subscribe Archive Privacy Policy News Twitter Instagram Youtube 1139 Longworth HOB Washington D.C. 20515 | P: (202) 225-3625

The Bidens’ Influence Peddling Timeline - United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability Skip to main content Toggle navigation Search About Chairman James Comer Full Committee Rules Committee Activity Calendar Hearings Letters Markups Reports Forums Subcommittees Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation Economic Growth, Energy Policy, and Regulatory Affairs Government Operations Health Care and Financial Services Military and Foreign Affairs Federal Law Enforcement Delivering on Government Efficiency Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets Media Center Press Releases The Overview Biden Family Investigation The Bidens’ Influence Peddling Timeline Biden's Border Crisis COVID Origins Blow the Whistle The Bidens’ Influence Peddling Timeline Since taking the gavel in January, the Committee on Oversight and Accountability has accelerated its investigation of the Biden family’s domestic and international business practices to determine whether the Biden family has been targeted by foreign actors, President Biden is compromised, and our national security is threatened. Records obtained through the Committee’s subpoenas to date reveal that the Bidens and their associates have received over $20 million in payments from foreign entities. Below is a timeline that details key dates in our investigation. The main points of interest are: 1) Romania: On September 28, 2015, Vice President Biden welcomed Romanian President Klaus Iohannis to the White House. Within five weeks of this meeting, a Romanian businessman involved with a high-profile corruption prosecution in Romania, Gabriel Popoviciu, began depositing a Biden associate’s bank account, which ultimately made their way into Biden family accounts. Popoviciu made sixteen of the seventeen payments, totaling over $3 million, to the Biden associate account while Joe Biden was Vice President. Biden family accounts ultimately received approximately $1.038 million. The total amount from Romania to the Biden family and their associates is over $3 million. 2) China- CEFC: On March 1, 2017—less than two months after Vice President Joe Biden left public office—State Energy HK Limited, a Chinese company, wired $3 million to a Biden associate’s account. This is the same bank account used in the above “Romania” section. After the Chinese company wired the Biden associate account the $3 million, the Biden family received approximately $1,065,692 over a three-month period in different bank accounts. Additionally, the CEFC Chairman gives Hunter Biden a diamond worth $80,000. Lastly, CEFC creates a joint venture with the Bidens in the summer of 2017. The timeline lays out the “WhatsApp” messages and subsequent wires from the Chinese to the Bidens of $100,000 and $5 million. The total amount from China, specifically with CEFC and their related entities, to the Biden family and their associates is over $8 million. 3) Kazakhstan: On April 22, 2014, Kenes Rakishev, a Kazakhstani oligarch used his Singaporean entity, Novatus Holdings, to wire one of Hunter Biden’s Rosemont Seneca entities $142,300. The very next day—April 23, 2014—the Rosemont Seneca entity transferred the exact same amount of money to a car dealership for a car for Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden and Devon Archer would represent Burisma in Kazakhstan in May/June of 2014 as the company attempted to broker a three-way deal among Burisma, the Kazakhstan government, and a Chinese state-owned energy company. 4) Ukraine: Devon Archer joined the Burisma board of directors in spring of 2014 and was joined by Hunter Biden shortly thereafter. Hunter Biden joined the company as counsel, but after a meeting with Burisma owner Mykola Zlochevsky in Lake Como, Italy, was elevated to the board of directors in the spring of 2014. Both Biden and Archer were each paid $1 million per year for their positions on the board of directors. In December 2015, after a Burisma board of directors meeting, Zlochevsky and Hunter Biden “called D.C.” in the wake of mounting pressures the company was facing. Zlochevsky was later charged with bribing Ukrainian officials with $6 million in an attempt to delay or drop the investigation into his company. The total amount from Ukraine to the Biden family and their associates is $6.5 million. 5) Russia: On February 14, 2014, a Russian oligarch and Russia’s richest woman, Yelena Baturina, wired a Rosemont Seneca entity $3.5 million. On March 11, 2014, the wire was split up: $750,000 was transferred to Devon Archer, and the remainder was sent to Rosemont Seneca Bohai, a company Devon Archer and Hunter Biden split equally. In spring of 2014, Yelena Baturina joined Hunter Biden and Devon Archer to share a meal with then-Vice President Biden at a restaurant in Washington, D.C. The total amount from Russia to the Biden family and their associates is $3.5 million.

[ 13 ] MBNA's rehiring of Biden was controversial because his father was pushing for passage of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act , which was beneficial to the credit card industry and supported by MBNA during Biden's time at the bank. [ 2 ] [ 16 ] The legislation made it more difficult to get bankruptcy protection. [ 16 ] Biden was appointed to a five-year term on the board of directors of Amtrak by President George W. Bush in 2006. [ 17 ] Biden was the board's vice chairman from July 2006 until he was replaced as vice chairman in January 2009. [ 18 ] He resigned from the board that February, [ 19 ] shortly after his father became vice president. Biden said during his father's vice-presidential campaign that it was time for his lobbying activities to end. [ 2 ] Investing, lobbying, and philanthropy In 2006, Biden and his uncle James Biden purchased international hedge fund Paradigm Global Advisors with an $8 million promissory note. [ 15 ] The joint promotion of the fund by an entity of the troubled Stanford Financial Group hastened the unwinding of the company in 2010. [ 20 ] In September 2008, Hunter Biden founded a consultancy company named Seneca Global Advisors that offered to help companies expand into foreign markets. [ 21 ] Biden was a partner in investment vehicles that included the name "Seneca" to denote his participation. [ 22 ] In 2009, Biden, Devon Archer, and Christopher Heinz founded the investment and advisory firm Rosemont Seneca Partners . [ 15 ] Biden also co-founded venture capital firm Eudora Global. [ 10 ] Biden held the position of counsel in the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner LLP in 2014. [ 2 ] From 2011 to 2017, Biden was on the board of directors of World Food Program USA, a 501(c)(3) charity based in Washington, D.C., that supports the work of the UN World Food Programme ; he served as board chairman from 2011 to 2015. [ 23 ] A detailed analysis of Hunter Biden's hard drive by NBC News showed that Biden and his firm were paid $11 million from 2013 to 2018, [ 24 ] including $3.8 million in payments from CEFC China Energy , [ 25 ] a defunct oil and gas company with links to the Chinese Communist Party , [ 26 ] as well as from Burisma Holdings. [ 24 ] In the U.S. criminal tax case against Hunter Biden, prosecutors allege he accepted payments from Romanian businessman Gabriel Popoviciu to influence U.S. government agencies regarding a criminal probe in Romania. Hunter Biden has pleaded guilty on 5 September 2024 to tax evasion and related charges. The allegations date back to his work for Popoviciu in 2015, during Joe Biden's vice presidency. [ 27 ] BHR Partners Main article: BHR Partners From 2013 to 2020, Biden served as a member of the board of the China-based private equity fund BHR Partners , of which he acquired a 10% stake in 2017 at a discount to actual value and with borrowed money. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] The founders of BHR Partners included Biden's Rosemont Seneca Partners investment firm (20% equity), along with US-based Thornton Group LLC (10% equity) and two asset managers registered in China. [ 30 ] [ 2 ] [ 21 ] The Chinese-registered asset managers are the Bank of China (via BOC International Holdings -backed Bohai Industrial Investment Fund Management) and Deutsche Bank -backed Harvest Fund Management . [ 31 ] In September 2019, while President Donald Trump was accusing Hunter Biden of malfeasance in Ukraine, he also falsely claimed that Biden "walk[ed] out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund". [ 32 ] Later in 2019, The Wall Street Journal confirmed that Trump was incorrect in claiming that Hunter received $1.5 billion, stating that Trump had no evidence to support the claim and that he incorrectly interpreted BHR's past fundraising target of $1.5 billion; BHR invested money raised from other companies and did not keep the funds. [ 33 ] Trump publicly called upon China to investigate Hunter Biden's business activities there while his father was vice president. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Hunter Biden announced his resignation from the board of directors of BHR Partners, effective the end of October 2019, citing "the barrage of false charges" by then-U.S. President Trump. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] This was confirmed by Biden's attorney, who said in November 2021 that his client no longer held any direct or indirect interest in BHR. [ 38 ] However, as of April 2020, Chinese business records showed that Hunter Biden remained a board member of BHR. [ 39 ] According to his lawyer, Biden had "not received any compensation for being on BHR's board of directors" nor had he received any return on his equity share in BHR. [ 40 ] Biden's lawyer George Mesires told The Washington Post that BHR Partners had been "capitalized from various sources with a total of 30 million RMB ( Renminbi ), or about $4.2 million, not $1.5 billion". [ 32 ] Biden's solely-owned company Skaneateles LLC owned a 10% equity stake in BHR as of December 2020. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] In November 2021, New York Times reported that "Chinese corporate records show Skaneateles remains a part owner of BHR". [ 38 ] Skaneateles was dissolved in 2022. BHR Partners invests Chinese venture capital into tech startups, such as an early-stage investment in Chinese auto hailing app DiDi [ 33 ] and cross-border acquisitions in automotive and mining, for example, the purchase of a stake in Democratic Republic of Congo copper and cobalt producer Tenke Fungurume Mining . [ 43 ] [ 44 ] The New York Times reported that BHR Partners helped finance a coal-mining company in Australia that was controlled by a Chinese state-owned enterprise , assisted a subsidiary of a Chinese defense company in acquiring an auto parts manufacturer in Michigan, and facilitated the $3.8 billion purchase of the DRC cobalt mine. A former BHR board member told the Times that Biden and the other American BHR founder, Devon Archer , were not involved in the mine deal. [ 38 ] [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Burisma Holdings See also: Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory and Trump–Ukraine scandal In April 2014, Biden joined the board of Burisma Holdings owned by Ukrainian oligarch and former politician Mykola Zlochevsky , who was facing a money laundering investigation just after the Ukrainian revolution . [ 47 ] [ 48 ] [ 49 ] Biden's business partner, Devon Archer, had joined the board of Burisma several months prior. Biden was hired to help Burisma with requesting assistance from the U.S government to expand its business and corporate governance best practices , while still an attorney with Boies Schiller Flexner . A consulting firm in which Biden is a partner was also retained by Burisma. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Christopher Heinz, John Kerry 's stepson, opposed his partners Devon Archer and Hunter Biden joining the board in 2014 due to the reputational risk . [ 48 ] Biden served on the board of Burisma until his term expired in April 2019, [ 52 ] receiving compensation of up to $50,000 per month. [ 52 ] [ 51 ] Because Joe Biden played a major role in U.S. policy towards Ukraine, some Ukrainian anti-corruption advocates [ 54 ] [ 55 ] and Obama administration officials expressed concern that Hunter Biden having joined the board could create the appearance of a conflict of interest and undermine Joe Biden's anti-corruption work in Ukraine. [ 2 ] [ 48 ] While serving as vice president, Joe Biden joined other Western leaders in encouraging the government of Ukraine to fire the country's top prosecutor Viktor Shokin , [ 56 ] [ 57 ] who was widely criticized for blocking corruption investigations. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] The Ukrainian parliament voted to remove Shokin in March 2016. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] Biden lobbied the U.S. State Department on behalf of Burisma to help secure a potentially lucrative energy project in Italy while his father was still Vice President. In 2016, Biden wrote a letter to the U.S. ambassador to Italy, John R. Phillips , which Biden's lawyer described as seeking to arrange an introduction between Burisma and the president of Italy's Tuscany region, the location of a potential Burisma energy project. A businessman involved in Burisma's project said that the outreach was undertaken at a time when Burisma was having difficulty securing regulatory approval for its Tuscany project. Embassy officials who handled the letter were concerned about the son of the sitting vice president reaching out on behalf of a foreign company, and Biden's request for a meeting was ultimately unmet. As President, Joe Biden released records confirming Hunter Biden's lobbying effort after dropping out of his 2024 presidential campaign , and denied being aware of it while vice president. [ 50 ] [ 62 ] Since early 2019, Hunter and his father Joe Biden have been the subjects of false and baseless claims of corrupt activities in a Biden–Ukraine conspiracy theory pushed by then-U.S. president Donald Trump and his allies. [ 63 ] Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani claimed in 2019, without evidence, that Joe Biden had sought the dismissal of Shokin in order to protect his son and Burisma Holdings. Actually, it was the official policy of the United States and the European Union to seek Shokin's removal. [ 64 ] [ 54 ] [ 56 ] [ 65 ] [ 66 ] There has also been no evidence produced of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden in Ukraine. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] The Ukrainian anti-corruption investigation agency stated in September 2019 that its current investigation of Burisma was restricted solely to investigating the period from 2010 to 2012, before Hunter Biden joined Burisma in 2014. [ 69 ] Shokin, in May 2019, claimed that he was fired because he had been actively investigating Burisma, [ 70 ] but U.S. and Ukrainian officials have stated that the investigation into Burisma was dormant at the time of Shokin's dismissal. [ 48 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ] Ukrainian and United States State Department sources note that Shokin was fired for failing to address corruption, including within his office. [ 65 ] [ 55 ] [ 72 ] In July 2019, Trump ordered the freezing of $391 million in military aid [ 73 ] shortly before a telephone conversation with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy in which Trump asked Zelenskyy to initiate an investigation of the Bidens. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] Trump falsely told Zelenskyy that "[Joe] Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution" of his son; Joe Biden did not stop any prosecution, did not brag about doing so, and there is no evidence his son was ever under investigation. [ 76 ] The United States House of Representatives initiated a formal impeachment inquiry on September 24, 2019, against Trump on the grounds that he may have sought to use U.S. foreign aid and the Ukrainian government to damage Joe Biden's 2020 presidential campaign . [ 77 ] Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko said in May 2019 that Hunter Biden had not violated Ukrainian law. After Lutsenko was replaced by Ruslan Riaboshapka as prosecutor general, Lutsenko and Riaboshapka said in September and October 2019 respectively that they had seen no evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. [ 56 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ] During 2019 and 2020, Republican senators Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley investigated Hunter Biden's involvement with Burisma, as well as allegations that Democrats colluded with the Ukrainian government to interfere in the 2016 election. The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee Republican senator Richard Burr privately expressed concerns to the senators that their inquiries could assist efforts by Russian intelligence to spread disinformation to disrupt American domestic affairs. [ 80 ] American intelligence officials briefed senators in late 2019 about Russian efforts to frame Ukraine for 2016 election interference. [ 81 ] Johnson said he would release findings in spring 2020, as Democrats would be selecting their 2020 presidential nominee, but instead ramped up the investigation at Trump's urging in May 2020, after it became clear that Joe Biden would be the nominee. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] Trump tweeted a press report about the investigations, later stating that he would make allegations of corruption by the Bidens a central theme of his re-election campaign. [ 81 ] Johnson decided in March 2020 against issuing a subpoena for former Ukrainian official Andrii Telizhenko, a Giuliani associate who had made appearances on the pro-Trump cable channel One America News , after the FBI briefed him about concerns Telizhenko could be spreading Russian disinformation. [ 84 ] The State Department revoked Telizhenko's visa in October 2020, and CNN reported the American government was considering sanctioning him as a Russian agent. [ 85 ] CNN reported that Vladislav Davidzon, the editor of Ukrainian magazine The Odessa Review , told CNN that in 2018 Telizhenko offered him money to lobby Republican senators in support of pro-Russian television stations in Ukraine. [ 86 ] When Johnson released the final report on the investigation, it contained no evidence that Joe Biden had pushed for Shokin's removal in order to benefit Hunter or Burisma. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] In June 2020, former Ukrainian prosecutor general Ruslan Riaboshapka stated that an audit of thousands of old case files he had ordered in October 2019 had found no wrongdoing by Hunter Biden. Riaboshapka was described by Zelenskyy as "100 percent my person" during the July 2019 call in which Trump asked him to investigate Biden. [ 89 ] Ukrainian lawmaker Andrii Derkach , an associate of Rudy Giuliani with links to Russian intelligence, released in May 2020 alleged snippets of recordings of Joe Biden speaking with Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko during the years Hunter Biden worked for Burisma. [ 90 ] The recordings, which were not verified as authentic and appeared heavily edited, depicted Biden linking loan guarantees for Ukraine to the ouster of the country's prosecutor general. The recordings did not provide evidence to support the ongoing conspiracy theory that Biden wanted the prosecutor fired to protect his son. [ 91 ] Poroshenko denied in June 2020 that Joe Biden ever approached him about Burisma. [ 92 ] [ 93 ] The United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Derkach in September 2020, stating he "has been an active Russian agent for over a decade, maintaining close connections with the Russian Intelligence Services". The Treasury Department added Derkach "waged a covert influence campaign centered on cultivating false and unsubstantiated narratives concerning U.S. officials in the upcoming 2020 Presidential Election" including by the release of "edited audio tapes and other unsupported information with the intent to discredit U.S. officials". [ 94 ] [ 95 ] Close associates of Derkach were also sanctioned by the Treasury Department in January 2021. [ 96 ] United States intelligence community analysis released in March 2021 found that Derkach was among proxies of Russian intelligence who promoted and laundered misleading or unsubstantiated narratives about Biden "to US media organizations, US officials, and prominent US individuals, including some close to former President Trump and his administration". [ 97 ] [ 98 ] Two Republicans on a Senate investigation committee in 2020 claimed that Russian businessperson Yelena Baturina , the wife of former Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov , wire-transferred $3.5 million in 2014 to Rosemont Seneca Thornton, of which Biden had previously been a partner. The Washington Post reported in April 2022 that the partners of Rosemont Seneca Thornton had agreed to dissolve the organization before the 2014 wire transfer, though it continued to be operated by Devin Archer to facilitate real estate transactions for eastern and central Asia investors, while Biden was uninvolved. Archer received the $3.5 million wire from Baturina to purchase property in Brooklyn, New York . [ 22 ] The Senate report cited unspecified confidential documents and gave no evidence that Biden personally accepted the funds. [ 99 ] Biden's attorney denied the report, saying Biden had no financial relationship with Baturina and no stake in the partnership that received the money, nor did he co-found the partnership. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] However, Trump's White House spokeswoman Alyssa Farah repeated the claim, and in a press conference Trump repeatedly asserted that Biden received millions of dollars from the former mayor's wife. [ 99 ] Investigations and federal indictments Main article: Weiss special counsel investigation In December 2020, Biden made a public announcement via his attorney that his tax affairs were under federal criminal investigation. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] The New York Times and CNN described the investigation as having started in late 2018 and being related to potential violations of tax and money laundering laws and Biden's business dealings in foreign countries, principally China. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] The Wall Street Journal reported that Biden had provided legal and consulting services that generated foreign-earned income, citing a Senate Republicans' report that $4.79 million in wire transfers from entities linked to Chinese energy tycoon Ye Jianming and his company, CEFC China Energy , were paying for such services. [ 104 ] The New York Times reported that FBI investigators had been unable to establish sufficient evidence for a prosecution of potential money laundering crimes, including after the seizure of a laptop belonging to Biden, and so the investigation progressed onto tax issues. [ 105 ] [ 106 ] Since October 2021, Hollywood attorney and writer Kevin Morris , who has become an influential adviser/confidant and now financier to Biden, lent Biden more than $6.5 million to pay back taxes, support his family, and fund legal expenses. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] The New York Times reported in March 2022 that, since 2018, Biden and possibly others had been under investigation by federal prosecutors in Delaware, with a grand jury convened to subpoena and hear evidence. The investigation examined payments and gifts Biden or his associates had received from foreign interests and whether Biden had violated the law by not registering as a lobbyist under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). The Times reported it had acquired emails that were authenticated by people familiar with them and the investigation that appeared to come from a laptop belonging to Biden. One April 2014 email, written by Biden to his business partner as their work with Burisma was about to begin, noted that his father, then the vice president who would soon visit Kyiv , should "be characterized as part of our advice and thinking—but what he will say and do is out of our hands". The email also stated that Burisma officials "need to know in no uncertain terms that we will not and cannot intervene directly with domestic policymakers, and that we need to abide by FARA and any other U.S. laws in the strictest sense across the board". Biden wrote that his father's visit "could be a really good thing or it could end up creating too great an expectation. We need to temper expectations regarding that visit." He also wrote that his employer, the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, could help Burisma through "direct discussions at state , energy and NSC [ United States National Security Council ]". Other emails showed Biden and his business partner discussing inviting foreign business associates, including a Burisma executive, to attend an April 2015 dinner in Washington, where the vice president would stop by. [ 109 ] A July 2022 report from CNN authenticated emails which showed that Biden was struggling with large debt and overdue tax bills. [ 110 ] [ 111 ] In October 2022, The Washington Post reported that federal agents had determined months prior that they had assembled enough evidence for a viable criminal case against Biden to charge him with crimes related to making false declarations during a gun purchase, as well as tax-related crimes. The next step was for Delaware U.S. attorney David C. Weiss , a holdover from the Trump administration, [ 112 ] to decide on whether to file such charges. [ 113 ] Federal investigators had also been examining the lobbying firm Blue Star Strategies, which Burisma retained while Biden sat on its board, for possible illegal lobbying of American officials. There was no indication Biden was a subject of the investigation. Blue Star employees said in Senate testimony that Biden was included in emails about the firm's work but that he was not particularly involved. One of the firm's co-founders said Biden did not direct its work. Blue Star's work came after Burisma's owner was criticized by the United States State Department, and the firm's founders testified the firm had merely approached officials to determine the government's views of Burisma. [ 114 ] [ 115 ] On June 20, 2023, in a deal with prosecutors, Biden agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges of failure to pay income tax, and to enter a pretrial diversion program related to a felony gun charge of unlawful possession of a firearm. [ 116 ] [ 117 ] [ 118 ] Prosecutors recommended two years of probation for the tax charges; the gun charge would be dropped at the end of this period if the conditions of the diversion program had been met successfully. [ 112 ] Having the gun charge dropped was conditional on Biden remaining drug-free and never being allowed to own a firearm again. [ 119 ] Biden's attorney said the agreement with prosecutors "resolved" the investigation, though the Justice Department said the investigation was "ongoing". In court on July 26, 2023, federal prosecutors explained that the "ongoing" aspect of the investigation referred to possible charges under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA); FARA requires that anyone who acts on the behalf of a foreign government, e.g. China or Ukraine, must register with the Department of Justice and file regular reports on their activities for that government. [ 120 ] On July 26, the plea deal was rejected by the presiding judge, who cited concerns over immunity Biden might receive from future charges, and gave 30 days to both the government prosecutors and Biden's defense team to provide additional information. [ 119 ] Biden changed his plea from "guilty" to "not guilty". [ 121 ] [ 122 ] On August 8, Weiss requested appointment as a special counsel in the Biden investigation, which attorney general Merrick Garland granted. Garland announced the appointment on August 11, the same day Weiss announced government and Biden attorneys could not reach agreement on a new plea deal. [ 123 ] [ 124 ] The Justice Department said on September 6 that Weiss would ask a grand jury to return an indictment of Biden on a gun charge by September 29. [ 125 ] On September 14, Biden was officially indicted in Delaware on three federal firearms-related charges: two for making false statements on a firearm application form and one for prohibited possession of a firearm. [ 126 ] He was arraigned on October 3 and pleaded not guilty to all charges. [ 127 ] Legal experts noted that prosecutions for these charges are rare. [ 128 ] [ 129 ] In January 2024, prosecutors urged a judge to not dismiss Biden's gun charge, revealing that cocaine residue was found in his gun pouch. [ 130 ] On December 7, 2023, Biden was indicted in California on nine tax charges, including three felony and six misdemeanor offenses. The indictment reads that "The Defendant engaged in a four-year scheme to not pay at least $1.4 million in self-assessed federal taxes he owed for tax years 2016 through 2019." Biden's lawyer said that Biden had repaid his taxes in full prior to the indictment. [ 131 ] [ 132 ] On January 11, 2024, Biden pleaded not guilty to the tax charges. [ 133 ] [ 134 ] The same day, U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi scheduled the trial for June 20, 2024. [ 135 ] [ 134 ] The trial was later delayed to September 5, 2024, due to the "needs of the defendant" in preparing for his Delaware trial on firearms charges in June. [ 136 ] Biden repeatedly sought to dismiss both tax and gun charges against him, without success. [ 137 ] [ 138 ] In August 2024, prosecutors alleged that Biden agreed to lobby on behalf of a Romanian businessman seeking to "influence U.S. government agencies" while his father was vice president. The businessman, Gabriel Popoviciu, was under criminal investigation in Romania at the time and hired Biden to assist in fighting his criminal charges through the US government. Prosecutors sought to introduce evidence from Biden's work with Popoviciu as part of his charges on tax evasion. [ 139 ] [ 140 ] A pre-trial hearing for the tax indictment which involved Biden's lawyers would be held on August 21, 2024. [ 141 ] Firearms trial and convictions A final pre-trial hearing for the gun charges was held on May 24, 2024. [ 142 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ] During the final hearing, Judge Maryellen Noreika ruled that prosecutors could not refer to his upcoming California tax trial, child support proceedings in Arkansas, his discharge from the Navy, or include statements which Biden made at a July 2023 hearing where his plea deal collapsed. [ 143 ] However, the prosecution was permitted to bring up Biden's drug use, portions of his memoir, and a summary of data from his laptop, phone, and iPad . [ 143 ] [ 145 ] Biden's trial began on June 3, 2024, on charges of unlawfully possessing a gun as a drug user, lying on a federal form when he bought the gun, and making a false statement about information required to be collected by a federally licensed gun dealer. The charges stemmed from a gun purchased and possessed by Biden in October 2018. During the trial, three of Biden's former partners testified regarding Biden's drug usage and gun purchase. [ 145 ] On June 11, Biden was found guilty on three felony charges for federal gun violations. [ 146 ] [ 147 ] The conviction made Biden the first child of a sitting U.S. president to be convicted in a criminal trial. [ 148 ] Due to his conviction on felony charges, Biden's license to practice law in Washington, D.C. was suspended. [ 149 ] Biden was scheduled to be sentenced on December 12, 2024, which did not occur due to him being pardoned by his father on December 1. [ 150 ] Tax indictment and guilty pleas On September 5, 2024, Biden's defense lawyer Abbe Lowell revealed that Biden would change his plea from not guilty to guilty in the federal tax case. [ 151 ] Biden had been indicted with three felony charges– one tax evasion count and two counts of filing false returns – and six misdemeanor charges. [ 152 ] It was not immediately clear if the presiding Judge Mark C. Scarsi would accept this plea proposal, which would be regarded as an Alford plea . [ 153 ] Under this proposed plea agreement, Biden would have accepted both a sentence and the strength of evidence against him, but also maintained his innocence. [ 154 ] [ 153 ] Later in the day, it was reported that this plea offer would not be accepted by the prosecution. [ 155 ] Initially, Judge Scarsi would neither accept the initial plea offer or call off the trial, but also did not make a final ruling and would opt to make a decision about the plea offer at a later time. [ 154 ] [ 156 ] Prosecutors said they would reject an Alford plea. [ 157 ] However, Scarsi would accept a guilty plea by the end of the day, with Biden pleading guilty to all nine charges. [ 158 ] During his plea hearing, Biden responded "Yes" after Scarsi asked him "Do you agree you committed every element of the charges in the indictment?" [ 158 ] Biden was scheduled to be sentenced on December 16, 2024 and he could have faced up to 17 years in prison. Former federal prosecutor, Tom Dupree, told CBS News he expected the judge to impose a sentence of fewer than five years. President Biden, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, First Lady Jill Biden, and White House spokesperson Andrew Bates repeatedly stated that the president would decline to pardon Hunter or commute his sentence. [ 158 ] [ 150 ] Pardon of criminal offenses Pardon dated December 1, 2024 On December 1, 2024, President Biden issued a full and unconditional pardon for his son. The pardon covered all federal offenses committed between January 1, 2014, and December 1, 2024, and included his tax charges, gun charges, and any other potential charges within that time. In an official White House statement from President Biden, he said that he believed his son was "selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted", and blamed political pressure for the failure of a plea deal for Hunter. [ 159 ] [ 160 ] He concluded by saying "I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision." The New York Times reported that the plea deal fell apart due to the presiding judge questioning its unusual construction, which violated a basic tenet of federal guilty pleas against having side deals in the plea agreement. [ 161 ] In court filings subsequent to the pardon, special counsel Weiss stated "there was none and never has been any evidence of vindictive or selective prosecution in this case". [ 162 ] Judge Scarsi stated that President Biden's characterizations "stand in tension with the case record" and that the Constitution does not "give the president the authority to rewrite history[.]" [ 163 ] The scope of the pardon was unusually broad and legal experts could recall only Richard Nixon as someone given similar terms for a pardon , for a term between 1969 and 1974. [ 164 ] [ 165 ] [ 150 ] The breadth of the pardon includes Hunter Biden's "entire tenure on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, as well as much of his other international work, including in China." [ 166 ] The pardon received bipartisan criticism from members of Congress as harming the justice system. [ 167 ] [ 168 ] In the months leading up to Hunter's scheduled sentencing, the President had made repeated statements that he would not use the pardon authority for his own son. He and his staff continued to state that there would be no pardon for Hunter as late as November, although internal staff discussions affirmed that the option for a pardon would remain on the table even as Biden publicly stated otherwise. [ 169 ] [ 150 ] Hunter issued the following statement in response to the pardon: I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction – mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport, I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering. [ 170 ] Laptop files Main article: Hunter Biden laptop controversy Hunter with his sister Ashley , at their father's inauguration, January 2021. Discovery of Hunter Biden's laptop was an October surprise prior to the 2020 election. [ 171 ] On October 14, 2020, twenty days prior to the 2020 United States presidential election , the New York Post published an article based on content provided to the publication by Donald Trump 's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and former chief strategist Steve Bannon . The article concerned what the Post said was a laptop computer that had belonged to Hunter Biden and that was allegedly left for repairs at a Wilmington, Delaware , computer shop. According to the narrative in the Post article, this device contained an email that referenced a "meeting" between Joe Biden and Vadym Pozharskyi, a Burisma advisor. [ 172 ] The article's veracity was strongly questioned at the time by many mainstream media outlets as well as dozens of current and former intelligence officials for possibly being a Russian disinformation campaign. [ 173 ] [ 174 ] (As of March 25, 2022, Vox reported that there was no evidence to corroborate the intelligence officials' suspicions that the laptop leak was part of a "Russian plot". [ 171 ] ) In January 2024, federal prosecutors stated that they had possession of a laptop computer which Hunter Biden left at the computer store and confirmed that the device contained files also found in cloud backups to Biden's Apple account. [ 175 ] In June 2024, the laptop and its contents were utilized as evidence during a federal court trial of Hunter Biden for firearms charges. FBI investigators testified at the trial, confirming the authenticity of the laptop, and stating that they had cross-referencing texts, emails, and messages found on the laptop with Apple and had verified the serial number on the laptop. Prosecutors also introduced the invoice from the repair shop as evidence. [ 176 ] [ 177 ] Biden was deposed by the House Judiciary and Oversight committees on February 28, 2024, which discussed emails found on the laptop. Biden stated during the deposition that he did not recall sending the laptop for repairs. [ 178 ] [ 179 ] In February 2023, Hunter Biden's attorneys wrote to the Justice Department National Security Division asking that they criminally investigate "individuals for whom there is considerable reason to believe violated various federal laws in accessing, copying, manipulating, and/or disseminating Mr. Biden's personal computer data". A similar letter was sent to the Attorney General of Delaware . The letters named Giuliani, Bannon, Mac Isaac (owner of the Wilmington computer repair shop where the laptop was abandoned), and others. [ 180 ] [ 181 ] The special counsel assigned to the case later described Hunter Biden's claim of right-wing bias as "fiction designed for a Hollywood script". [ 175 ] Another event resulting from discovery of the laptop occurred in January 2023: an anonymous Twitter account posted a rental application found on the laptop, leading to a false claim that in 2018 Hunter Biden had paid rent while residing at his father's Delaware home, where classified documents had been found . James Comer , chair of the House Oversight Committee that was investigating the Biden family , inquired whether it was evidence that Hunter Biden illicitly provided money from his foreign business activities to his father. The document was determined to be a quarterly rental payment for office space at the House of Sweden in Washington, D.C. [ 182 ] Navy Reserve Biden's application for a position in the U.S. Navy Reserve was approved in May 2013. [ 183 ] At age 43, Biden was accepted as part of a program that allows a limited number of applicants with desirable skills to receive commissions and serve in staff positions. [ 184 ] Biden received an age-related waiver and a waiver for a past drug-related incident; he was sworn in as a direct commission officer by his father in a White House ceremony. [ 183 ] [ 2 ] Results of a routine urinalysis taken on Biden's first weekend of reserve duty revealed cocaine in his system. [ 2 ] [ 184 ] He was discharged administratively in February 2014. [ 184 ] [ 185 ] Biden attributed the result to having smoked a cigarette that he had asked a group of men outside a store to give him, claiming the cigarette contained cocaine as well as tobacco. [ 2 ] He did not appeal the discharge, stating that he thought it unlikely the panel would believe his explanation given his history of drug addiction. [ 186 ] [ 2 ] Biden also stated that he did not appeal due to the likelihood that this would result in the press becoming aware of the discharge; however, it was eventually disclosed to The Wall Street Journal by a Navy official. [ 2 ] [ 183 ] Work as an artist In February 2020, The New York Times reported that Biden had been painting as an "undiscovered artist" in his Hollywood Hills home. The report also displayed some of his paintings, including "Untitled #4 (a study in ink)" and "Untitled #3 (a signed work)". [ 187 ] Biden's art dealer, Georges Bergès, hosted a private viewing for Biden in Los Angeles in fall 2021, followed by an exhibition in New York. [ 188 ] Biden's paintings were put up for sale for as much as $500,000 per painting, with Kevin Morris purchasing $875,000 worth of his art. [ 189 ] Another buyer was Elizabeth Hirsh Naftali, a prominent California Democratic Party donor who was appointed to the U.S. Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad by Joe Biden. Business Insider was unable to verify how much Hirsh Naftali spent on the art, nor whether the purchase occurred before or after her appointment. An ethicist interviewed by the news website said that the purchase was ethically problematic, particularly if it occurred before her appointment, as "it might be perceived as a quid pro quo ." [ 190 ] The purchases provoked concerns about possible conflicts of interest and a lack of transparency. [ 191 ] [ 192 ] According to court filings by Biden, between December 2021 and December 2023, he sold approximately $1.5 million of his art. [ 193 ] From December 2023 to March 2025, he sold $36,000 of art. [ 193 ] Presidency of Joe Biden During his father's presidency, Hunter emerged as one of six key individuals who insulated Joe from scrutiny and acted as an intermediary between him and others. [ 194 ] After a poor presidential debate performance by Joe in June 2024 caused intensified public concern about his age and fitness for the presidency, Hunter helped Joe with speech preparation and began joining meetings with the president and his staffers. [ 195 ] Hunter maintained daily, often hourly contact with his father on calls. Joe increasingly relied on Hunter for advice, and Hunter emerged as one of the strongest voices in Joe's circle urging him not to drop out of his reelection campaign . [ 196 ] [ 197 ] [ 198 ] [ 199 ] Hunter had been a regular presence in public White House events, but his increased involvement in Biden's presidency and campaign led to surprise and concern from White House staffers. After Joe's poor debate performance, Hunter advocated for Joe to fire some of his top staffers, including Anita Dunn and Bob Bauer . Hunter also began acting as a "de facto gatekeeper" for access to the president. [ 197 ] [ 199 ] [ 200 ] Litigation Between 2023 and 2024, Hunter privately sued numerous individuals, organizations, and the U.S. Government alleging various instances of invasion of privacy and defamation. In September 2023, Biden filed suit against the IRS , claiming unlawful disclosures of his tax return information in relation to two IRS employees who provided information to members of Congress. [ 201 ] The D.C. District Court dismissed his claim under the Privacy Act in September 2024, and Biden dropped the suit altogether in 2025. [ 202 ] In 2023, Biden sued Garrett Ziegler 's Marco Polo organization, accusing the group of invasion of privacy for publishing 128,000 of his emails that were recovered from his lost laptop computer. [ 203 ] In March 2025, Biden sought to have the case dismissed due to his worsening personal financial situation and inability to continue to pay for his own legal representation. [ 203 ] In 2024, Biden sued Rudy Giuliani alleging Giuliani was responsible for the "total annihilation" of his privacy due to his involvement in releasing data from his laptop computer. [ 204 ] He dropped the lawsuit shortly thereafter. [ 204 ] The same year, he sued Fox News for airing images taken from the laptop, but dropped the lawsuit without explanation the following month. [ 205 ] Three months later, however, he resurrected the lawsuit in state court. [ 206 ] In a statement, Fox News described the second lawsuit as "devoid of any merit". [ 206 ] Later life Following the presidency of Joe Biden, according to The Daily Beast , Hunter fell "on hard times". [ 207 ] The prior year — in 2024 — his law license had been suspended, NBC News noting at the time that it was unclear what impact the suspension would have on his livelihood. [ 208 ] In January 2025, his rental home was damaged and left uninhabitable during the Palisades Fire and he had difficulty finding new housing, resulting in him experiencing homelessness. By this point, he was several million dollars in debt and his income severely impacted by flagging interest in his memoir, which was selling less than 200 copies per month. In court filings, Biden averred that he had anticipated earning money from invitations for paid speaking engagements, but no such invitations had materialized. [ 207 ] [ 209 ] In March 2025, Hunter's Secret Service detail was withdrawn on the direction of Donald Trump. Prior to the end of his term, Joe Biden had ordered an extended period of post-presidency protection for Hunter. [ 210 ] Personal life Relationships Biden (center) with family at his brother Beau's funeral in June 2015 In 1993, Biden married Kathleen Buhle . [ 2 ] They have three daughters: Naomi (named after Biden's sister), [ 211 ] Finnegan, and Maisey. [ 10 ] The couple formally separated in October 2015, and divorced in 2017. [ 212 ] [ 213 ] Buhle's 2022 memoir If We Break documents her account of the relationship. [ 214 ] Biden began a relationship with his brother's widow Hallie Olivere Biden in 2016. [ 215 ] [ 2 ] The relationship ended in 2019. [ 2 ] [ 216 ] [ 217 ] Between 2017 and 2018, Biden also had a romantic relationship with Zoë Kestan . [ 217 ] Biden has a fourth daughter, born in August 2018 in Arkansas , to Lunden Alexis Roberts. [ 218 ] [ 219 ] Biden initially denied that the child was his, but a DNA test , conducted as part of a paternity suit filed in May 2019 by Roberts, confirmed he is the father. The lawsuit was settled in March 2020 after Biden agreed to pay Roberts $20,000 a month in child support. [ 220 ] [ 221 ] Biden filed a motion in September 2022 to reduce his child support payments, on the basis of reduced income; Roberts opposed this request and also petitioned the Arkansas court to change the child's surname to Biden, so that his daughter might benefit from associations with Biden's family. [ 222 ] In June 2023, Biden and Roberts settled the dispute. As part of the settlement, Biden agreed to give several of his paintings to his daughter and pay an undisclosed monthly amount in child support until the daughter turns 18. Biden also agreed to assist with college tuition. Roberts agreed to drop her petition to change their daughter's surname. [ 223 ] [ 224 ] [ 225 ] The matter received significant attention in the media. [ 226 ] Biden married South African filmmaker Melissa Cohen in May 2019, within a week of first meeting her. [ 186 ] [ 227 ] Their son, named Beau in honor of Biden's brother, was born in March 2020 in Los Angeles. [ 228 ] [ 229 ] Drug and alcohol abuse Biden has abused drugs and alcohol throughout his adult life, which he has detailed in his 2021 memoir. [ 230 ] [ 231 ] He believes his addiction issues are linked to episodes of family loss he suffered, [ 232 ] beginning with the 1972 motor vehicle accident that killed his mother and sister. [ 233 ] Biden said that his family never talked much with him about the accident, and this allowed the emotional trauma he felt to remain unresolved; it worsened following the death of his brother, Beau. [ 232 ] Over the past two decades, Biden has been in multiple substance abuse rehabilitation programs , each followed by an interval of sobriety followed by relapse. At his worst, Biden stated that he was "smoking crack every 15 minutes". [ 234 ] The $11 million Biden and his firm were paid from 2013 to 2018 fueled his addiction. In his memoir, he wrote that the money "turned into a major enabler during my steepest skid into addiction" and "hounded me to spend recklessly, dangerously, destructively. Humiliatingly. So I did." [ 24 ] He had an intervention in early 2019. [ 235 ] Memoir Biden released Beautiful Things , a memoir of the trauma of the accident that claimed his mother and sister, and his later addiction struggles, on April 6, 2021. [ 236 ] The New York Times described the book as "equal parts family saga, grief narrative and addict's howl". [ 237 ] References ^ Phelps, Jordyn; Saenz, Arlette (August 25, 2015).

During the 2020 election campaign, he and his father were frequently accused by Donald Trump and his associates of wrongdoing in regards to China and Ukraine, allegations which they both denied. The New York Post reported on an alleged email in which an adviser from a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, apparently thanked Hunter for inviting him to meet his father, Joe Biden. Asked about the allegations, Joe Biden told a reporter it was a "smear campaign". No criminal activity has been proven, and no evidence has emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. In an interview with the BBC months after his father was sworn in as president, Hunter Biden defended his qualifications for the position at Burisma but added that, in retrospect, he had "missed... the perception that I would create". Claims of influence-peddling are common in Washington DC and Mr Trump's children have also been accused of conflicts of interest in lucrative business deals overseas. They, too, deny wrongdoing. What do we know about the federal investigation? The Justice Department is investigating Hunter Biden's finances including scrutinising some of his past Chinese business dealings and other transactions, a "person familiar with the matter" told The Associated Press in December . The tax investigation was launched in 2018 but Hunter Biden said he had learned about it for the first time in December 2020. Asked about the investigation by US broadcaster CBS this April, the president's son said: "I'm co-operating, completely. And I'm absolutely certain, 100% certain, that at the end of the investigation, that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing." What have the Bidens been accused of in China? The New York Post cited a purported email from Hunter Biden in August 2017 indicating he was receiving a $10m annual fee from a Chinese billionaire for "introductions alone", though it is unclear who was involved in the alleged introductions. Another purported email, which Fox News said it had confirmed, reportedly refers to a deal pursued by Hunter involving China's largest private energy firm. It is said to include a cryptic mention of "10 held by H for the big guy". Fox News cited unnamed sources as saying "the big guy" in the purported email was a reference to Joe Biden. This message is said to be from May 2017. Both emails would date from when the former US vice-president was a private citizen. A former business associate of Hunter Biden has come forward to say he can confirm the allegations. Tony Bobulinski told Fox News that, contrary to Joe Biden's statements that he had nothing to do with his son's business affairs, Hunter had "frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals" in China. Mr Bobulinski, who is reportedly a US Navy veteran, separately told Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he had met on two occasions with Joe Biden to discuss business deals with China, the first time in May 2017 when Barack Obama's former vice-president was a private citizen. He says he asked Joe Biden's brother, James, whether the family was concerned about possible scrutiny of the former vice-president's involvement in a potential business deal with a Chinese entity. Mr Bobulinski told Fox News that James Biden had replied: "Plausible deniability." Mr Bobulinski was invited by Mr Trump to be his guest at the final presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee on 22 October. What is known about Hunter's dealings in China? In 2013, Hunter flew aboard Air Force Two with his father, who was then vice-president, on an official visit to Beijing, where the younger Biden met investment banker Jonathan Li. Hunter told the New Yorker he had just met Mr Li for "a cup of coffee", but 12 days after the trip a private equity fund, BHR Partners, was approved by the Chinese authorities. Mr Li was chief executive and Hunter was a board member. He would hold a 10% stake. Getty Images Joe Biden walks out of Air Force Two with his granddaughter and son, Hunter Biden BHR is backed by some of China's largest state banks and by local governments, according to US media. Hunter Biden's lawyer said he had joined the board in an unpaid position "based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets". His lawyer also said his client did not acquire his financial stake in BHR until 2017, after his father had left office in the US. Hunter resigned from the board of BHR in April 2020, but still held his 10% stake in BHR as of July this year, according to the company report. What did the New York Post say about Hunter Biden and Ukraine? The New York Post reported an email from April 2015, in which an adviser to Burisma, Vadym Pozharskyi, apparently thanked Hunter Biden for inviting him to meet his father in Washington. Hunter was a director on the board of Burisma - a Ukrainian-owned private energy company while his father was the Obama administration's pointman on US-Ukrainian relations. Hunter was one of several foreigners on its board. The New York Post article did not provide evidence that the meeting had ever taken place. The Biden election campaign said there was no record of any such meeting on the former vice-president's "official schedule" from the time. But in a statement to Politico , the campaign also acknowledged that Mr Biden could have had an "informal interaction" with the Burisma adviser that did not appear on his official schedule, though it said any such encounter would have been "cursory". "Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague, have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official US policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing," said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr Biden. What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Biden's team has also decried the New York Post story as "Russian disinformation", though it did not say the emails were bogus. The New York Post article was shared by President Trump and his allies. Two of his former advisers, Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani, were involved in providing the story and the hard drive containing the alleged emails, to the newspaper. Mr Giuliani says the messages were found on a laptop that Hunter dropped off at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. Sceptics have noted that Mr Giuliani travelled in December 2019 to Kyiv where he met Ukrainian lawmaker Andriy Derkach, whom the US Treasury has designated as a longtime Kremlin agent. Mr Giuliani has acknowledged trying dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine. But the US Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, told Fox Business that the purported emails were not connected to a Russian disinformation effort. Other US media say they have been unable to verify the authenticity of the emails. Hunter has neither confirmed nor denied that he dropped off a laptop at the location. Hunter joined Burisma in 2014, and remained on the board until April 2019, when he decided to leave. Speaking to the BBC, he said Burisma had seen his name "as gold" and that it had played a large part in his appointment to the board. Twitter and Facebook's action over Joe Biden article reignites bias claims What are the Bidens accused of in Ukraine? Donald Trump and his allies accused Joe Biden of wrongdoing because he had pushed, while vice-president, for the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, who was investigating the company for which Hunter worked. In 2016, Joe Biden called for the dismissal of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin, whose office had Burisma and other companies under investigation. However, other Western leaders and major bodies that give financial support to Ukraine also wanted the prosecutor dismissed because they believed he was not active enough in tackling corruption. What else has the Biden campaign said? Shortly before the final presidential debate last year, the Democrat's camp released a statement denying wrongdoing. "Joe Biden has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever," said the statement. "He has never held stock in any such business arrangements nor has any family member or any other person ever held stock for him. "What is true is that Tony Bobulinski admitted on the record to Breitbart that he is angry that he was *not* able to go into business with Hunter and James Biden [Joe Biden's brother]." What did this have to do with impeachment? In 2019, details emerged of a phone call Mr Trump, the then president, had made to the president of Ukraine, in which he had urged the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens. President Trump's impeachment explained This led to charges by the Democrats that Mr Trump was trying to illegally pressure Ukraine to help damage his election rival, resulting in impeachment by the House of Representatives. Mr Trump denied he had done anything wrong, and he was later acquitted by the Republican-controlled US Senate. Getty Images President Trump holds a copy of The Washington Post the day after the US Senate acquitted him on two articles of impeachment Has anything been proven against the Bidens? While no criminal activity has been proven, it has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. A senior State Department official raised such concerns as far back as 2015. Joe Biden's son defends foreign dealings US Republican lawmakers launched an investigation and found last year that Hunter's work for the Ukrainian firm had been "problematic" - but there wasn't evidence that US foreign policy was influenced by it. No criminal charges were proven against Burisma either. The company issued a statement in 2017 saying "all legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations" against it were closed. Last year, Yuriy Lutsenko, the prosecutor in Ukraine who succeeded Viktor Shokin, told the BBC that there was no reason to investigate the Bidens under Ukrainian law. There is nothing illegal about sitting on a board of a company whilst family members serve in government. Hunter Biden's lawyers said in statement in October 2019 that he had undertaken "these business activities independently.

During the 2020 election campaign, he and his father were frequently accused by Donald Trump and his associates of wrongdoing in regards to China and Ukraine, allegations which they both denied. The New York Post reported on an alleged email in which an adviser from a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, apparently thanked Hunter for inviting him to meet his father, Joe Biden. Asked about the allegations, Joe Biden told a reporter it was a "smear campaign". No criminal activity has been proven, and no evidence has emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. In an interview with the BBC months after his father was sworn in as president, Hunter Biden defended his qualifications for the position at Burisma but added that, in retrospect, he had "missed... the perception that I would create". Claims of influence-peddling are common in Washington DC and Mr Trump's children have also been accused of conflicts of interest in lucrative business deals overseas. They, too, deny wrongdoing. What do we know about the federal investigation? The Justice Department is investigating Hunter Biden's finances including scrutinising some of his past Chinese business dealings and other transactions, a "person familiar with the matter" told The Associated Press in December . The tax investigation was launched in 2018 but Hunter Biden said he had learned about it for the first time in December 2020. Asked about the investigation by US broadcaster CBS this April, the president's son said: "I'm co-operating, completely. And I'm absolutely certain, 100% certain, that at the end of the investigation, that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing." What have the Bidens been accused of in China? The New York Post cited a purported email from Hunter Biden in August 2017 indicating he was receiving a $10m annual fee from a Chinese billionaire for "introductions alone", though it is unclear who was involved in the alleged introductions. Another purported email, which Fox News said it had confirmed, reportedly refers to a deal pursued by Hunter involving China's largest private energy firm. It is said to include a cryptic mention of "10 held by H for the big guy". Fox News cited unnamed sources as saying "the big guy" in the purported email was a reference to Joe Biden. This message is said to be from May 2017. Both emails would date from when the former US vice-president was a private citizen. A former business associate of Hunter Biden has come forward to say he can confirm the allegations. Tony Bobulinski told Fox News that, contrary to Joe Biden's statements that he had nothing to do with his son's business affairs, Hunter had "frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals" in China. Mr Bobulinski, who is reportedly a US Navy veteran, separately told Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he had met on two occasions with Joe Biden to discuss business deals with China, the first time in May 2017 when Barack Obama's former vice-president was a private citizen. He says he asked Joe Biden's brother, James, whether the family was concerned about possible scrutiny of the former vice-president's involvement in a potential business deal with a Chinese entity. Mr Bobulinski told Fox News that James Biden had replied: "Plausible deniability." Mr Bobulinski was invited by Mr Trump to be his guest at the final presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee on 22 October. What is known about Hunter's dealings in China? In 2013, Hunter flew aboard Air Force Two with his father, who was then vice-president, on an official visit to Beijing, where the younger Biden met investment banker Jonathan Li. Hunter told the New Yorker he had just met Mr Li for "a cup of coffee", but 12 days after the trip a private equity fund, BHR Partners, was approved by the Chinese authorities. Mr Li was chief executive and Hunter was a board member. He would hold a 10% stake. Getty Images Joe Biden walks out of Air Force Two with his granddaughter and son, Hunter Biden BHR is backed by some of China's largest state banks and by local governments, according to US media. Hunter Biden's lawyer said he had joined the board in an unpaid position "based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets". His lawyer also said his client did not acquire his financial stake in BHR until 2017, after his father had left office in the US. Hunter resigned from the board of BHR in April 2020, but still held his 10% stake in BHR as of July this year, according to the company report. What did the New York Post say about Hunter Biden and Ukraine? The New York Post reported an email from April 2015, in which an adviser to Burisma, Vadym Pozharskyi, apparently thanked Hunter Biden for inviting him to meet his father in Washington. Hunter was a director on the board of Burisma - a Ukrainian-owned private energy company while his father was the Obama administration's pointman on US-Ukrainian relations. Hunter was one of several foreigners on its board. The New York Post article did not provide evidence that the meeting had ever taken place. The Biden election campaign said there was no record of any such meeting on the former vice-president's "official schedule" from the time. But in a statement to Politico , the campaign also acknowledged that Mr Biden could have had an "informal interaction" with the Burisma adviser that did not appear on his official schedule, though it said any such encounter would have been "cursory". "Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague, have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official US policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing," said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr Biden. What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Biden's team has also decried the New York Post story as "Russian disinformation", though it did not say the emails were bogus. The New York Post article was shared by President Trump and his allies. Two of his former advisers, Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani, were involved in providing the story and the hard drive containing the alleged emails, to the newspaper. Mr Giuliani says the messages were found on a laptop that Hunter dropped off at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. Sceptics have noted that Mr Giuliani travelled in December 2019 to Kyiv where he met Ukrainian lawmaker Andriy Derkach, whom the US Treasury has designated as a longtime Kremlin agent. Mr Giuliani has acknowledged trying dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine. But the US Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, told Fox Business that the purported emails were not connected to a Russian disinformation effort. Other US media say they have been unable to verify the authenticity of the emails. Hunter has neither confirmed nor denied that he dropped off a laptop at the location. Hunter joined Burisma in 2014, and remained on the board until April 2019, when he decided to leave. Speaking to the BBC, he said Burisma had seen his name "as gold" and that it had played a large part in his appointment to the board. Twitter and Facebook's action over Joe Biden article reignites bias claims What are the Bidens accused of in Ukraine? Donald Trump and his allies accused Joe Biden of wrongdoing because he had pushed, while vice-president, for the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, who was investigating the company for which Hunter worked. In 2016, Joe Biden called for the dismissal of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin, whose office had Burisma and other companies under investigation. However, other Western leaders and major bodies that give financial support to Ukraine also wanted the prosecutor dismissed because they believed he was not active enough in tackling corruption. What else has the Biden campaign said? Shortly before the final presidential debate last year, the Democrat's camp released a statement denying wrongdoing. "Joe Biden has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever," said the statement. "He has never held stock in any such business arrangements nor has any family member or any other person ever held stock for him. "What is true is that Tony Bobulinski admitted on the record to Breitbart that he is angry that he was *not* able to go into business with Hunter and James Biden [Joe Biden's brother]." What did this have to do with impeachment? In 2019, details emerged of a phone call Mr Trump, the then president, had made to the president of Ukraine, in which he had urged the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens. President Trump's impeachment explained This led to charges by the Democrats that Mr Trump was trying to illegally pressure Ukraine to help damage his election rival, resulting in impeachment by the House of Representatives. Mr Trump denied he had done anything wrong, and he was later acquitted by the Republican-controlled US Senate. Getty Images President Trump holds a copy of The Washington Post the day after the US Senate acquitted him on two articles of impeachment Has anything been proven against the Bidens? While no criminal activity has been proven, it has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. A senior State Department official raised such concerns as far back as 2015. Joe Biden's son defends foreign dealings US Republican lawmakers launched an investigation and found last year that Hunter's work for the Ukrainian firm had been "problematic" - but there wasn't evidence that US foreign policy was influenced by it. No criminal charges were proven against Burisma either. The company issued a statement in 2017 saying "all legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations" against it were closed. Last year, Yuriy Lutsenko, the prosecutor in Ukraine who succeeded Viktor Shokin, told the BBC that there was no reason to investigate the Bidens under Ukrainian law. There is nothing illegal about sitting on a board of a company whilst family members serve in government. Hunter Biden's lawyers said in statement in October 2019 that he had undertaken "these business activities independently. He did not believe it appropriate to discuss them with his father, nor did he." Hunter told the New Yorker magazine that on the only occasion he had mentioned Burisma: "Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing.'" Amid all the scrutiny, Joe Biden promised last year that if he was elected president, no-one in his family would hold a job or have a business relationship with a foreign corporation or foreign government.

While framed by the president as addressing Hunter’s gun and tax charges, the pardon stunningly covers all crimes Hunter “committed or may have committed” from 2014 to 2023, a period covering Hunter’s questionable business dealings in Ukraine, China, and other foreign nations. In 2014, Hunter began receiving $1 million annually from Burisma, a company controlled by a Ukrainian oligarch which dealt in energy holdings, an industry with which Hunter had no relevant experience. Also, in February 2014, then-Vice-President Joe Biden dined with Russian and Kazakhstani oligarchs who were shortly thereafter responsible for millions of dollars in suspect money transfers including $142,300 which appears to have covered the cost of a car for Hunter. Rather than supporting the integrity of the legal system, by issuing this pardon, President Biden did the opposite and instead decided to put family above fairness to American taxpayers and law-abiding citizens. This is an unacceptable abuse of presidential powers. It has been said, “eternal vigilance is the price of liberty," and after the historic inflation, regulatory overreach, and failures of leadership we’ve seen throughout the Biden-Harris administration, it is clear reining in the excesses of the federal government has never been more urgent. As Republicans look forward to advancing sound policy for the American people in the coming year, we are preparing to deliver government accountability to the taxpayers, families, and small businesses which make up the backbone of our economy. This week, the office of Sen. Joni Ernst released a report showing only 6 percent of the more than two million federal employees work completely in-person rather than telework or remote work. Meanwhile, leasing, maintenance, and operations for federal office buildings costs taxpayers approximately $15.7 billion annually. This is the reason I supported the SHOW UP Act in 2023 to require federal agency employees to show up for work and get back to the business of serving the American people. Unfortunately, the bill has been ignored by Democrats in the Senate and White House. I am eager to ensure the government works more efficiently for the American people and welcome the opportunity to work toward this goal with Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and President Trump’s newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) which aims to address wasteful federal spending and bureaucratic bloat in the coming year. The IRS will be a good place for DOGE’s work to start. Overhauling the IRS requires new leadership. I applaud President Trump’s announcement of his plan to remove the current Commissioner Danny Werfel and nominate my former colleague, Billy Long to fill the role. Despite his commitments to “world-class customer service” and “to roll up [his] sleeves to help working families” during his confirmation process, Commissioner Werfel’s tenure at the IRS has instead focused on advancing the Biden-Harris agenda to intrude further into the financial privacy of American families and small businesses. We need an IRS commissioner who will restore accountability to the agency and its employees, ensure unelected bureaucrats do not harass Americans on the basis of ideology as it did under the Obama administration, simplify tax compliance, protect taxpayer data and privacy, update antiquated technology systems, return to wholly appropriated funding, end the unlawful Direct File Program, and have a true focus on serving taxpayers well. I hope Rep. Long will demonstrate his capacity to do this as the Senate considers his nomination. To combat inflation caused by overspending, clean up the morass of overregulation, and hold those entrusted with power accountable, we need to refocus and repair how the federal government serves Americans. In many ways this looks like getting Washington out of the way and allowing the American people do what they do best. President Ronald Reagan famously said, “the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government, and I'm here to help.” It’s about time we restore accountability and focus on efficiency governmentwide. ### Issues : Economy Taxes Office Locations Washington DC Office 502 Cannon HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-6435 Fax: (202) 225-0207 Nebraska City District Office 202 South 8th Street Suite A Nebraska City, NE 68410 Phone: (402) 874-6050 Fax: (402) 874-6049 Grand Island District Office 1811 West Second Street Suite 275 Grand Island, NE 68803 Phone: (308) 384-3900 Fax: (308) 384-3902 Scottsbluff District Office 416 Valley View Dr. Suite 600 Scottsbluff, NE 69361 Phone: (308) 633-6333 Fax: (308) 633-6335 Copyright Privacy House.gov Accessibility RSSICYMI: Whistleblower Docs Show Burisma Hired Hunter Biden for His “Political Weight” and Carefully Navigated His Appointment to Protect Joe Biden – Ways and Means Skip to content About The Chairman The Committee Membership Subcommittees Internships News 2025 Tax Teams Activity Hearings Markups Calendar Listening To Americans Twitter Instagram Youtube ICYMI: Whistleblower Docs Show Burisma Hired Hunter Biden for His “Political Weight” and Carefully Navigated His Appointment to Protect Joe Biden November 17, 2023 A series of spreadsheets and emails included within the over 700 pages of whistleblower documents released by Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (MO-08) last month show an alarming pattern of meetings between senior White House staff, Hunter Biden business associate Devon Archer, and Hunter Biden in the same year then-Vice President Biden made an unprecedented three official visits to Ukraine. At the same time those meetings occurred, Archer was negotiating Hunter Biden’s position on the board of directors of Burisma – a Ukrainian company – whose executives implied his value to their company was his influence with his father. They even acknowledged the sensitive optics surrounding his appointment to the company’s board, and discussed the need to make his appointment public only after then-Vice President Biden’s first official trip to Ukraine concluded. April 15, 2014: Devon Archer meets with Vice President Biden at the White House. April 16, 2014: Hunter Biden has coffee with Greg Schultz, Senior Advisor to Vice President Biden. Later that same day, Hunter Biden meets with Devon Archer at the White House. April 17, 2014: A Burisma executive emails Devon Archer stating, as it relates to Hunter Biden, “ I do believe we have to reach a reasonable balance here ” and acknowledged they were relying on Hunter Biden’s influence with his father and would take into account how to use “ the political weight of our Directors… carefully and strategically. ” The email went on to say they would list Hunter Biden on their website “ after his father left our country” and underlined how Burisma could not, “hide our directors. ” April 21, 2014: Then-Vice President Joe Biden travels to Ukraine. May 12, 2014 : Hunter Biden appointed to Burisma’s board of directors. May 13, 2014: According to emails obtained from the Hunter Biden laptop, Eric Schwerin, another Hunter Biden business associate, directed a photo of Joe Biden and Devon Archer that was taken at the April 15th White House meeting be removed from Burisma’s website at the request of the Vice President’s General Counsel. June 7, 2014: Then-Vice President Joe Biden travels to Ukraine for a second time to attend the inauguration of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. September 24, 2014: Devon Archer forwards an email to Hunter Biden discussing the need to “alert U.S. officials who might be able to influence Ukraine to not adopt such harmful measures.” October 27, 2014: Hunter Biden receives an email from a U.S. government official stating, “Secretary of State may be calling you soon.” November 20, 2014: Then-Vice President Biden visits Ukraine for a third time. December 17, 2014: Eric Schwerin emails Hunter Biden to request then-Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s email address. Chairman Smith said, “It is hard to believe the timing of Hunter Biden’s appointment to the board of Burisma and his father’s multiple official visits to Ukraine are mere coincidence. House Republicans are determined to get to the bottom of the Biden family’s influence peddling scheme, and the American people have a right to know if then-Vice President Biden used his official government position to help his family’s overseas business operations. “Thanks to the IRS whistleblowers we know President Biden lied when he said he had no knowledge and was not involved in his son’s business dealings. It now appears he in fact benefited. We will continue to follow the facts in this investigation and present the truth to the American people.” READ : Bombshell: Ways and Means Releases New Documents Revealing Hunter Biden Selling Access to White House, Investigators Blocked from Pursuing Evidence Related to President Biden READ : ICYMI: Documents Confirm Joe Biden was his Family’s “Only Asset” and “The Brand” READ : ICYMI: New Documents Link Biden Family Influence Peddling Scheme to 23 Countries, Four Continents READ : ICYMI: Hunter Biden’s Business Associates Enjoyed White House Dinners, Flights on Air Force 2 Internships Minority Subscribe Archive Privacy Policy News Twitter Instagram Youtube 1139 Longworth HOB Washington D.C. 20515 | P: (202) 225-3625Hunter Biden: What was he doing in China and Ukraine?

President Trump's impeachment explained This led to charges by the Democrats that Mr Trump was trying to illegally pressure Ukraine to help damage his election rival, resulting in impeachment by the House of Representatives. Mr Trump denied he had done anything wrong, and he was later acquitted by the Republican-controlled US Senate. Getty Images President Trump holds a copy of The Washington Post the day after the US Senate acquitted him on two articles of impeachment Has anything been proven against the Bidens? While no criminal activity has been proven, it has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. A senior State Department official raised such concerns as far back as 2015. Joe Biden's son defends foreign dealings US Republican lawmakers launched an investigation and found last year that Hunter's work for the Ukrainian firm had been "problematic" - but there wasn't evidence that US foreign policy was influenced by it. No criminal charges were proven against Burisma either. The company issued a statement in 2017 saying "all legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations" against it were closed. Last year, Yuriy Lutsenko, the prosecutor in Ukraine who succeeded Viktor Shokin, told the BBC that there was no reason to investigate the Bidens under Ukrainian law. There is nothing illegal about sitting on a board of a company whilst family members serve in government. Hunter Biden's lawyers said in statement in October 2019 that he had undertaken "these business activities independently. He did not believe it appropriate to discuss them with his father, nor did he." Hunter told the New Yorker magazine that on the only occasion he had mentioned Burisma: "Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing.'" Amid all the scrutiny, Joe Biden promised last year that if he was elected president, no-one in his family would hold a job or have a business relationship with a foreign corporation or foreign government.

During the 2020 election campaign, he and his father were frequently accused by Donald Trump and his associates of wrongdoing in regards to China and Ukraine, allegations which they both denied. The New York Post reported on an alleged email in which an adviser from a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, apparently thanked Hunter for inviting him to meet his father, Joe Biden. Asked about the allegations, Joe Biden told a reporter it was a "smear campaign". No criminal activity has been proven, and no evidence has emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. In an interview with the BBC months after his father was sworn in as president, Hunter Biden defended his qualifications for the position at Burisma but added that, in retrospect, he had "missed... the perception that I would create". Claims of influence-peddling are common in Washington DC and Mr Trump's children have also been accused of conflicts of interest in lucrative business deals overseas. They, too, deny wrongdoing. What do we know about the federal investigation? The Justice Department is investigating Hunter Biden's finances including scrutinising some of his past Chinese business dealings and other transactions, a "person familiar with the matter" told The Associated Press in December . The tax investigation was launched in 2018 but Hunter Biden said he had learned about it for the first time in December 2020. Asked about the investigation by US broadcaster CBS this April, the president's son said: "I'm co-operating, completely. And I'm absolutely certain, 100% certain, that at the end of the investigation, that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing." What have the Bidens been accused of in China? The New York Post cited a purported email from Hunter Biden in August 2017 indicating he was receiving a $10m annual fee from a Chinese billionaire for "introductions alone", though it is unclear who was involved in the alleged introductions. Another purported email, which Fox News said it had confirmed, reportedly refers to a deal pursued by Hunter involving China's largest private energy firm. It is said to include a cryptic mention of "10 held by H for the big guy". Fox News cited unnamed sources as saying "the big guy" in the purported email was a reference to Joe Biden. This message is said to be from May 2017. Both emails would date from when the former US vice-president was a private citizen. A former business associate of Hunter Biden has come forward to say he can confirm the allegations. Tony Bobulinski told Fox News that, contrary to Joe Biden's statements that he had nothing to do with his son's business affairs, Hunter had "frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals" in China. Mr Bobulinski, who is reportedly a US Navy veteran, separately told Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he had met on two occasions with Joe Biden to discuss business deals with China, the first time in May 2017 when Barack Obama's former vice-president was a private citizen. He says he asked Joe Biden's brother, James, whether the family was concerned about possible scrutiny of the former vice-president's involvement in a potential business deal with a Chinese entity. Mr Bobulinski told Fox News that James Biden had replied: "Plausible deniability." Mr Bobulinski was invited by Mr Trump to be his guest at the final presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee on 22 October. What is known about Hunter's dealings in China? In 2013, Hunter flew aboard Air Force Two with his father, who was then vice-president, on an official visit to Beijing, where the younger Biden met investment banker Jonathan Li. Hunter told the New Yorker he had just met Mr Li for "a cup of coffee", but 12 days after the trip a private equity fund, BHR Partners, was approved by the Chinese authorities. Mr Li was chief executive and Hunter was a board member. He would hold a 10% stake. Getty Images Joe Biden walks out of Air Force Two with his granddaughter and son, Hunter Biden BHR is backed by some of China's largest state banks and by local governments, according to US media. Hunter Biden's lawyer said he had joined the board in an unpaid position "based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets". His lawyer also said his client did not acquire his financial stake in BHR until 2017, after his father had left office in the US. Hunter resigned from the board of BHR in April 2020, but still held his 10% stake in BHR as of July this year, according to the company report. What did the New York Post say about Hunter Biden and Ukraine? The New York Post reported an email from April 2015, in which an adviser to Burisma, Vadym Pozharskyi, apparently thanked Hunter Biden for inviting him to meet his father in Washington. Hunter was a director on the board of Burisma - a Ukrainian-owned private energy company while his father was the Obama administration's pointman on US-Ukrainian relations. Hunter was one of several foreigners on its board. The New York Post article did not provide evidence that the meeting had ever taken place. The Biden election campaign said there was no record of any such meeting on the former vice-president's "official schedule" from the time. But in a statement to Politico , the campaign also acknowledged that Mr Biden could have had an "informal interaction" with the Burisma adviser that did not appear on his official schedule, though it said any such encounter would have been "cursory". "Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague, have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official US policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing," said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr Biden. What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Biden's team has also decried the New York Post story as "Russian disinformation", though it did not say the emails were bogus. The New York Post article was shared by President Trump and his allies. Two of his former advisers, Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani, were involved in providing the story and the hard drive containing the alleged emails, to the newspaper. Mr Giuliani says the messages were found on a laptop that Hunter dropped off at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. Sceptics have noted that Mr Giuliani travelled in December 2019 to Kyiv where he met Ukrainian lawmaker Andriy Derkach, whom the US Treasury has designated as a longtime Kremlin agent. Mr Giuliani has acknowledged trying dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine. But the US Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, told Fox Business that the purported emails were not connected to a Russian disinformation effort. Other US media say they have been unable to verify the authenticity of the emails. Hunter has neither confirmed nor denied that he dropped off a laptop at the location. Hunter joined Burisma in 2014, and remained on the board until April 2019, when he decided to leave. Speaking to the BBC, he said Burisma had seen his name "as gold" and that it had played a large part in his appointment to the board. Twitter and Facebook's action over Joe Biden article reignites bias claims What are the Bidens accused of in Ukraine? Donald Trump and his allies accused Joe Biden of wrongdoing because he had pushed, while vice-president, for the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, who was investigating the company for which Hunter worked. In 2016, Joe Biden called for the dismissal of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin, whose office had Burisma and other companies under investigation. However, other Western leaders and major bodies that give financial support to Ukraine also wanted the prosecutor dismissed because they believed he was not active enough in tackling corruption. What else has the Biden campaign said? Shortly before the final presidential debate last year, the Democrat's camp released a statement denying wrongdoing. "Joe Biden has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever," said the statement. "He has never held stock in any such business arrangements nor has any family member or any other person ever held stock for him. "What is true is that Tony Bobulinski admitted on the record to Breitbart that he is angry that he was *not* able to go into business with Hunter and James Biden [Joe Biden's brother]."

While framed by the president as addressing Hunter’s gun and tax charges, the pardon stunningly covers all crimes Hunter “committed or may have committed” from 2014 to 2023, a period covering Hunter’s questionable business dealings in Ukraine, China, and other foreign nations. In 2014, Hunter began receiving $1 million annually from Burisma, a company controlled by a Ukrainian oligarch which dealt in energy holdings, an industry with which Hunter had no relevant experience. Also, in February 2014, then-Vice-President Joe Biden dined with Russian and Kazakhstani oligarchs who were shortly thereafter responsible for millions of dollars in suspect money transfers including $142,300 which appears to have covered the cost of a car for Hunter. Rather than supporting the integrity of the legal system, by issuing this pardon, President Biden did the opposite and instead decided to put family above fairness to American taxpayers and law-abiding citizens. This is an unacceptable abuse of presidential powers. It has been said, “eternal vigilance is the price of liberty," and after the historic inflation, regulatory overreach, and failures of leadership we’ve seen throughout the Biden-Harris administration, it is clear reining in the excesses of the federal government has never been more urgent. As Republicans look forward to advancing sound policy for the American people in the coming year, we are preparing to deliver government accountability to the taxpayers, families, and small businesses which make up the backbone of our economy. This week, the office of Sen. Joni Ernst released a report showing only 6 percent of the more than two million federal employees work completely in-person rather than telework or remote work. Meanwhile, leasing, maintenance, and operations for federal office buildings costs taxpayers approximately $15.7 billion annually. This is the reason I supported the SHOW UP Act in 2023 to require federal agency employees to show up for work and get back to the business of serving the American people. Unfortunately, the bill has been ignored by Democrats in the Senate and White House. I am eager to ensure the government works more efficiently for the American people and welcome the opportunity to work toward this goal with Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and President Trump’s newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) which aims to address wasteful federal spending and bureaucratic bloat in the coming year. The IRS will be a good place for DOGE’s work to start. Overhauling the IRS requires new leadership. I applaud President Trump’s announcement of his plan to remove the current Commissioner Danny Werfel and nominate my former colleague, Billy Long to fill the role. Despite his commitments to “world-class customer service” and “to roll up [his] sleeves to help working families” during his confirmation process, Commissioner Werfel’s tenure at the IRS has instead focused on advancing the Biden-Harris agenda to intrude further into the financial privacy of American families and small businesses. We need an IRS commissioner who will restore accountability to the agency and its employees, ensure unelected bureaucrats do not harass Americans on the basis of ideology as it did under the Obama administration, simplify tax compliance, protect taxpayer data and privacy, update antiquated technology systems, return to wholly appropriated funding, end the unlawful Direct File Program, and have a true focus on serving taxpayers well. I hope Rep. Long will demonstrate his capacity to do this as the Senate considers his nomination. To combat inflation caused by overspending, clean up the morass of overregulation, and hold those entrusted with power accountable, we need to refocus and repair how the federal government serves Americans. In many ways this looks like getting Washington out of the way and allowing the American people do what they do best. President Ronald Reagan famously said, “the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government, and I'm here to help.” It’s about time we restore accountability and focus on efficiency governmentwide. ### Issues : Economy Taxes Office Locations Washington DC Office 502 Cannon HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-6435 Fax: (202) 225-0207 Nebraska City District Office 202 South 8th Street Suite A Nebraska City, NE 68410 Phone: (402) 874-6050 Fax: (402) 874-6049 Grand Island District Office 1811 West Second Street Suite 275 Grand Island, NE 68803 Phone: (308) 384-3900 Fax: (308) 384-3902 Scottsbluff District Office 416 Valley View Dr. Suite 600 Scottsbluff, NE 69361 Phone: (308) 633-6333 Fax: (308) 633-6335 Copyright Privacy House.gov Accessibility RSSICYMI: Whistleblower Docs Show Burisma Hired Hunter Biden for His “Political Weight” and Carefully Navigated His Appointment to Protect Joe Biden – Ways and Means Skip to content About The Chairman The Committee Membership Subcommittees Internships News 2025 Tax Teams Activity Hearings Markups Calendar Listening To Americans Twitter Instagram Youtube ICYMI: Whistleblower Docs Show Burisma Hired Hunter Biden for His “Political Weight” and Carefully Navigated His Appointment to Protect Joe Biden November 17, 2023 A series of spreadsheets and emails included within the over 700 pages of whistleblower documents released by Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (MO-08) last month show an alarming pattern of meetings between senior White House staff, Hunter Biden business associate Devon Archer, and Hunter Biden in the same year then-Vice President Biden made an unprecedented three official visits to Ukraine. At the same time those meetings occurred, Archer was negotiating Hunter Biden’s position on the board of directors of Burisma – a Ukrainian company – whose executives implied his value to their company was his influence with his father. They even acknowledged the sensitive optics surrounding his appointment to the company’s board, and discussed the need to make his appointment public only after then-Vice President Biden’s first official trip to Ukraine concluded. April 15, 2014: Devon Archer meets with Vice President Biden at the White House. April 16, 2014: Hunter Biden has coffee with Greg Schultz, Senior Advisor to Vice President Biden. Later that same day, Hunter Biden meets with Devon Archer at the White House. April 17, 2014: A Burisma executive emails Devon Archer stating, as it relates to Hunter Biden, “ I do believe we have to reach a reasonable balance here ” and acknowledged they were relying on Hunter Biden’s influence with his father and would take into account how to use “ the political weight of our Directors… carefully and strategically. ” The email went on to say they would list Hunter Biden on their website “ after his father left our country” and underlined how Burisma could not, “hide our directors. ” April 21, 2014: Then-Vice President Joe Biden travels to Ukraine. May 12, 2014 : Hunter Biden appointed to Burisma’s board of directors. May 13, 2014: According to emails obtained from the Hunter Biden laptop, Eric Schwerin, another Hunter Biden business associate, directed a photo of Joe Biden and Devon Archer that was taken at the April 15th White House meeting be removed from Burisma’s website at the request of the Vice President’s General Counsel. June 7, 2014: Then-Vice President Joe Biden travels to Ukraine for a second time to attend the inauguration of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. September 24, 2014: Devon Archer forwards an email to Hunter Biden discussing the need to “alert U.S. officials who might be able to influence Ukraine to not adopt such harmful measures.” October 27, 2014: Hunter Biden receives an email from a U.S. government official stating, “Secretary of State may be calling you soon.” November 20, 2014: Then-Vice President Biden visits Ukraine for a third time. December 17, 2014: Eric Schwerin emails Hunter Biden to request then-Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s email address. Chairman Smith said, “It is hard to believe the timing of Hunter Biden’s appointment to the board of Burisma and his father’s multiple official visits to Ukraine are mere coincidence. House Republicans are determined to get to the bottom of the Biden family’s influence peddling scheme, and the American people have a right to know if then-Vice President Biden used his official government position to help his family’s overseas business operations. “Thanks to the IRS whistleblowers we know President Biden lied when he said he had no knowledge and was not involved in his son’s business dealings. It now appears he in fact benefited. We will continue to follow the facts in this investigation and present the truth to the American people.” READ : Bombshell: Ways and Means Releases New Documents Revealing Hunter Biden Selling Access to White House, Investigators Blocked from Pursuing Evidence Related to President Biden READ : ICYMI: Documents Confirm Joe Biden was his Family’s “Only Asset” and “The Brand” READ : ICYMI: New Documents Link Biden Family Influence Peddling Scheme to 23 Countries, Four Continents READ : ICYMI: Hunter Biden’s Business Associates Enjoyed White House Dinners, Flights on Air Force 2 Internships Minority Subscribe Archive Privacy Policy News Twitter Instagram Youtube 1139 Longworth HOB Washington D.C. 20515 | P: (202) 225-3625ICYMI: President Trump’s Largest Tax Cut in History – The White House Menu President Donald J.

Mr Li was chief executive and Hunter was a board member. He would hold a 10% stake.

Hunter Biden's lawyer said he had joined the board in an unpaid position "based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets". His lawyer also said his client did not acquire his financial stake in BHR until 2017, after his father had left office in the US. Hunter resigned from the board of BHR in April 2020, but still held his 10% stake in BHR as of July this year, according to the company report. What did the New York Post say about Hunter Biden and Ukraine? The New York Post reported an email from April 2015, in which an adviser to Burisma, Vadym Pozharskyi, apparently thanked Hunter Biden for inviting him to meet his father in Washington. Hunter was a director on the board of Burisma - a Ukrainian-owned private energy company while his father was the Obama administration's pointman on US-Ukrainian relations. Hunter was one of several foreigners on its board. The New York Post article did not provide evidence that the meeting had ever taken place. The Biden election campaign said there was no record of any such meeting on the former vice-president's "official schedule" from the time. But in a statement to Politico , the campaign also acknowledged that Mr Biden could have had an "informal interaction" with the Burisma adviser that did not appear on his official schedule, though it said any such encounter would have been "cursory". "Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague, have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official US policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing," said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr Biden. What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Biden's team has also decried the New York Post story as "Russian disinformation", though it did not say the emails were bogus. The New York Post article was shared by President Trump and his allies. Two of his former advisers, Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani, were involved in providing the story and the hard drive containing the alleged emails, to the newspaper. Mr Giuliani says the messages were found on a laptop that Hunter dropped off at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. Sceptics have noted that Mr Giuliani travelled in December 2019 to Kyiv where he met Ukrainian lawmaker Andriy Derkach, whom the US Treasury has designated as a longtime Kremlin agent. Mr Giuliani has acknowledged trying dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine. But the US Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, told Fox Business that the purported emails were not connected to a Russian disinformation effort. Other US media say they have been unable to verify the authenticity of the emails. Hunter has neither confirmed nor denied that he dropped off a laptop at the location. Hunter joined Burisma in 2014, and remained on the board until April 2019, when he decided to leave. Speaking to the BBC, he said Burisma had seen his name "as gold" and that it had played a large part in his appointment to the board. Twitter and Facebook's action over Joe Biden article reignites bias claims What are the Bidens accused of in Ukraine? Donald Trump and his allies accused Joe Biden of wrongdoing because he had pushed, while vice-president, for the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, who was investigating the company for which Hunter worked. In 2016, Joe Biden called for the dismissal of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin, whose office had Burisma and other companies under investigation. However, other Western leaders and major bodies that give financial support to Ukraine also wanted the prosecutor dismissed because they believed he was not active enough in tackling corruption. What else has the Biden campaign said? Shortly before the final presidential debate last year, the Democrat's camp released a statement denying wrongdoing. "Joe Biden has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever," said the statement. "He has never held stock in any such business arrangements nor has any family member or any other person ever held stock for him. "What is true is that Tony Bobulinski admitted on the record to Breitbart that he is angry that he was *not* able to go into business with Hunter and James Biden [Joe Biden's brother]." What did this have to do with impeachment? In 2019, details emerged of a phone call Mr Trump, the then president, had made to the president of Ukraine, in which he had urged the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens. President Trump's impeachment explained This led to charges by the Democrats that Mr Trump was trying to illegally pressure Ukraine to help damage his election rival, resulting in impeachment by the House of Representatives. Mr Trump denied he had done anything wrong, and he was later acquitted by the Republican-controlled US Senate. Getty Images President Trump holds a copy of The Washington Post the day after the US Senate acquitted him on two articles of impeachment Has anything been proven against the Bidens? While no criminal activity has been proven, it has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. A senior State Department official raised such concerns as far back as 2015. Joe Biden's son defends foreign dealings US Republican lawmakers launched an investigation and found last year that Hunter's work for the Ukrainian firm had been "problematic" - but there wasn't evidence that US foreign policy was influenced by it. No criminal charges were proven against Burisma either. The company issued a statement in 2017 saying "all legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations" against it were closed. Last year, Yuriy Lutsenko, the prosecutor in Ukraine who succeeded Viktor Shokin, told the BBC that there was no reason to investigate the Bidens under Ukrainian law. There is nothing illegal about sitting on a board of a company whilst family members serve in government. Hunter Biden's lawyers said in statement in October 2019 that he had undertaken "these business activities independently. He did not believe it appropriate to discuss them with his father, nor did he." Hunter told the New Yorker magazine that on the only occasion he had mentioned Burisma: "Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing.'" Amid all the scrutiny, Joe Biden promised last year that if he was elected president, no-one in his family would hold a job or have a business relationship with a foreign corporation or foreign government.

During the 2020 election campaign, he and his father were frequently accused by Donald Trump and his associates of wrongdoing in regards to China and Ukraine, allegations which they both denied. The New York Post reported on an alleged email in which an adviser from a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, apparently thanked Hunter for inviting him to meet his father, Joe Biden. Asked about the allegations, Joe Biden told a reporter it was a "smear campaign". No criminal activity has been proven, and no evidence has emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. In an interview with the BBC months after his father was sworn in as president, Hunter Biden defended his qualifications for the position at Burisma but added that, in retrospect, he had "missed... the perception that I would create". Claims of influence-peddling are common in Washington DC and Mr Trump's children have also been accused of conflicts of interest in lucrative business deals overseas. They, too, deny wrongdoing. What do we know about the federal investigation? The Justice Department is investigating Hunter Biden's finances including scrutinising some of his past Chinese business dealings and other transactions, a "person familiar with the matter" told The Associated Press in December . The tax investigation was launched in 2018 but Hunter Biden said he had learned about it for the first time in December 2020. Asked about the investigation by US broadcaster CBS this April, the president's son said: "I'm co-operating, completely. And I'm absolutely certain, 100% certain, that at the end of the investigation, that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing." What have the Bidens been accused of in China? The New York Post cited a purported email from Hunter Biden in August 2017 indicating he was receiving a $10m annual fee from a Chinese billionaire for "introductions alone", though it is unclear who was involved in the alleged introductions. Another purported email, which Fox News said it had confirmed, reportedly refers to a deal pursued by Hunter involving China's largest private energy firm. It is said to include a cryptic mention of "10 held by H for the big guy". Fox News cited unnamed sources as saying "the big guy" in the purported email was a reference to Joe Biden. This message is said to be from May 2017. Both emails would date from when the former US vice-president was a private citizen. A former business associate of Hunter Biden has come forward to say he can confirm the allegations. Tony Bobulinski told Fox News that, contrary to Joe Biden's statements that he had nothing to do with his son's business affairs, Hunter had "frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals" in China. Mr Bobulinski, who is reportedly a US Navy veteran, separately told Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he had met on two occasions with Joe Biden to discuss business deals with China, the first time in May 2017 when Barack Obama's former vice-president was a private citizen. He says he asked Joe Biden's brother, James, whether the family was concerned about possible scrutiny of the former vice-president's involvement in a potential business deal with a Chinese entity. Mr Bobulinski told Fox News that James Biden had replied: "Plausible deniability." Mr Bobulinski was invited by Mr Trump to be his guest at the final presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee on 22 October. What is known about Hunter's dealings in China?

While framed by the president as addressing Hunter’s gun and tax charges, the pardon stunningly covers all crimes Hunter “committed or may have committed” from 2014 to 2023, a period covering Hunter’s questionable business dealings in Ukraine, China, and other foreign nations. In 2014, Hunter began receiving $1 million annually from Burisma, a company controlled by a Ukrainian oligarch which dealt in energy holdings, an industry with which Hunter had no relevant experience. Also, in February 2014, then-Vice-President Joe Biden dined with Russian and Kazakhstani oligarchs who were shortly thereafter responsible for millions of dollars in suspect money transfers including $142,300 which appears to have covered the cost of a car for Hunter. Rather than supporting the integrity of the legal system, by issuing this pardon, President Biden did the opposite and instead decided to put family above fairness to American taxpayers and law-abiding citizens. This is an unacceptable abuse of presidential powers. It has been said, “eternal vigilance is the price of liberty," and after the historic inflation, regulatory overreach, and failures of leadership we’ve seen throughout the Biden-Harris administration, it is clear reining in the excesses of the federal government has never been more urgent. As Republicans look forward to advancing sound policy for the American people in the coming year, we are preparing to deliver government accountability to the taxpayers, families, and small businesses which make up the backbone of our economy. This week, the office of Sen. Joni Ernst released a report showing only 6 percent of the more than two million federal employees work completely in-person rather than telework or remote work. Meanwhile, leasing, maintenance, and operations for federal office buildings costs taxpayers approximately $15.7 billion annually. This is the reason I supported the SHOW UP Act in 2023 to require federal agency employees to show up for work and get back to the business of serving the American people. Unfortunately, the bill has been ignored by Democrats in the Senate and White House. I am eager to ensure the government works more efficiently for the American people and welcome the opportunity to work toward this goal with Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and President Trump’s newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) which aims to address wasteful federal spending and bureaucratic bloat in the coming year. The IRS will be a good place for DOGE’s work to start. Overhauling the IRS requires new leadership. I applaud President Trump’s announcement of his plan to remove the current Commissioner Danny Werfel and nominate my former colleague, Billy Long to fill the role. Despite his commitments to “world-class customer service” and “to roll up [his] sleeves to help working families” during his confirmation process, Commissioner Werfel’s tenure at the IRS has instead focused on advancing the Biden-Harris agenda to intrude further into the financial privacy of American families and small businesses. We need an IRS commissioner who will restore accountability to the agency and its employees, ensure unelected bureaucrats do not harass Americans on the basis of ideology as it did under the Obama administration, simplify tax compliance, protect taxpayer data and privacy, update antiquated technology systems, return to wholly appropriated funding, end the unlawful Direct File Program, and have a true focus on serving taxpayers well. I hope Rep. Long will demonstrate his capacity to do this as the Senate considers his nomination. To combat inflation caused by overspending, clean up the morass of overregulation, and hold those entrusted with power accountable, we need to refocus and repair how the federal government serves Americans. In many ways this looks like getting Washington out of the way and allowing the American people do what they do best. President Ronald Reagan famously said, “the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government, and I'm here to help.” It’s about time we restore accountability and focus on efficiency governmentwide. ### Issues : Economy Taxes Office Locations Washington DC Office 502 Cannon HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-6435 Fax: (202) 225-0207 Nebraska City District Office 202 South 8th Street Suite A Nebraska City, NE 68410 Phone: (402) 874-6050 Fax: (402) 874-6049 Grand Island District Office 1811 West Second Street Suite 275 Grand Island, NE 68803 Phone: (308) 384-3900 Fax: (308) 384-3902 Scottsbluff District Office 416 Valley View Dr. Suite 600 Scottsbluff, NE 69361 Phone: (308) 633-6333 Fax: (308) 633-6335 Copyright Privacy House.gov Accessibility RSSICYMI: Whistleblower Docs Show Burisma Hired Hunter Biden for His “Political Weight” and Carefully Navigated His Appointment to Protect Joe Biden – Ways and Means Skip to content About The Chairman The Committee Membership Subcommittees Internships News 2025 Tax Teams Activity Hearings Markups Calendar Listening To Americans Twitter Instagram Youtube ICYMI: Whistleblower Docs Show Burisma Hired Hunter Biden for His “Political Weight” and Carefully Navigated His Appointment to Protect Joe Biden November 17, 2023 A series of spreadsheets and emails included within the over 700 pages of whistleblower documents released by Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (MO-08) last month show an alarming pattern of meetings between senior White House staff, Hunter Biden business associate Devon Archer, and Hunter Biden in the same year then-Vice President Biden made an unprecedented three official visits to Ukraine. At the same time those meetings occurred, Archer was negotiating Hunter Biden’s position on the board of directors of Burisma – a Ukrainian company – whose executives implied his value to their company was his influence with his father. They even acknowledged the sensitive optics surrounding his appointment to the company’s board, and discussed the need to make his appointment public only after then-Vice President Biden’s first official trip to Ukraine concluded. April 15, 2014: Devon Archer meets with Vice President Biden at the White House. April 16, 2014: Hunter Biden has coffee with Greg Schultz, Senior Advisor to Vice President Biden. Later that same day, Hunter Biden meets with Devon Archer at the White House. April 17, 2014: A Burisma executive emails Devon Archer stating, as it relates to Hunter Biden, “ I do believe we have to reach a reasonable balance here ” and acknowledged they were relying on Hunter Biden’s influence with his father and would take into account how to use “ the political weight of our Directors… carefully and strategically. ” The email went on to say they would list Hunter Biden on their website “ after his father left our country” and underlined how Burisma could not, “hide our directors. ” April 21, 2014: Then-Vice President Joe Biden travels to Ukraine. May 12, 2014 : Hunter Biden appointed to Burisma’s board of directors. May 13, 2014: According to emails obtained from the Hunter Biden laptop, Eric Schwerin, another Hunter Biden business associate, directed a photo of Joe Biden and Devon Archer that was taken at the April 15th White House meeting be removed from Burisma’s website at the request of the Vice President’s General Counsel. June 7, 2014: Then-Vice President Joe Biden travels to Ukraine for a second time to attend the inauguration of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. September 24, 2014: Devon Archer forwards an email to Hunter Biden discussing the need to “alert U.S. officials who might be able to influence Ukraine to not adopt such harmful measures.” October 27, 2014: Hunter Biden receives an email from a U.S. government official stating, “Secretary of State may be calling you soon.” November 20, 2014: Then-Vice President Biden visits Ukraine for a third time. December 17, 2014: Eric Schwerin emails Hunter Biden to request then-Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s email address. Chairman Smith said, “It is hard to believe the timing of Hunter Biden’s appointment to the board of Burisma and his father’s multiple official visits to Ukraine are mere coincidence. House Republicans are determined to get to the bottom of the Biden family’s influence peddling scheme, and the American people have a right to know if then-Vice President Biden used his official government position to help his family’s overseas business operations. “Thanks to the IRS whistleblowers we know President Biden lied when he said he had no knowledge and was not involved in his son’s business dealings. It now appears he in fact benefited. We will continue to follow the facts in this investigation and present the truth to the American people.” READ : Bombshell: Ways and Means Releases New Documents Revealing Hunter Biden Selling Access to White House, Investigators Blocked from Pursuing Evidence Related to President Biden READ : ICYMI: Documents Confirm Joe Biden was his Family’s “Only Asset” and “The Brand” READ : ICYMI: New Documents Link Biden Family Influence Peddling Scheme to 23 Countries, Four Continents READ : ICYMI: Hunter Biden’s Business Associates Enjoyed White House Dinners, Flights on Air Force 2 Internships Minority Subscribe Archive Privacy Policy News Twitter Instagram Youtube 1139 Longworth HOB Washington D.C. 20515 | P: (202) 225-3625Hunter Biden: What was he doing in China and Ukraine?

It is said to include a cryptic mention of "10 held by H for the big guy". Fox News cited unnamed sources as saying "the big guy" in the purported email was a reference to Joe Biden. This message is said to be from May 2017. Both emails would date from when the former US vice-president was a private citizen. A former business associate of Hunter Biden has come forward to say he can confirm the allegations. Tony Bobulinski told Fox News that, contrary to Joe Biden's statements that he had nothing to do with his son's business affairs, Hunter had "frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals" in China. Mr Bobulinski, who is reportedly a US Navy veteran, separately told Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he had met on two occasions with Joe Biden to discuss business deals with China, the first time in May 2017 when Barack Obama's former vice-president was a private citizen. He says he asked Joe Biden's brother, James, whether the family was concerned about possible scrutiny of the former vice-president's involvement in a potential business deal with a Chinese entity. Mr Bobulinski told Fox News that James Biden had replied: "Plausible deniability." Mr Bobulinski was invited by Mr Trump to be his guest at the final presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee on 22 October. What is known about Hunter's dealings in China? In 2013, Hunter flew aboard Air Force Two with his father, who was then vice-president, on an official visit to Beijing, where the younger Biden met investment banker Jonathan Li. Hunter told the New Yorker he had just met Mr Li for "a cup of coffee", but 12 days after the trip a private equity fund, BHR Partners, was approved by the Chinese authorities. Mr Li was chief executive and Hunter was a board member. He would hold a 10% stake. Getty Images Joe Biden walks out of Air Force Two with his granddaughter and son, Hunter Biden BHR is backed by some of China's largest state banks and by local governments, according to US media. Hunter Biden's lawyer said he had joined the board in an unpaid position "based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets". His lawyer also said his client did not acquire his financial stake in BHR until 2017, after his father had left office in the US. Hunter resigned from the board of BHR in April 2020, but still held his 10% stake in BHR as of July this year, according to the company report. What did the New York Post say about Hunter Biden and Ukraine? The New York Post reported an email from April 2015, in which an adviser to Burisma, Vadym Pozharskyi, apparently thanked Hunter Biden for inviting him to meet his father in Washington. Hunter was a director on the board of Burisma - a Ukrainian-owned private energy company while his father was the Obama administration's pointman on US-Ukrainian relations. Hunter was one of several foreigners on its board. The New York Post article did not provide evidence that the meeting had ever taken place. The Biden election campaign said there was no record of any such meeting on the former vice-president's "official schedule" from the time. But in a statement to Politico , the campaign also acknowledged that Mr Biden could have had an "informal interaction" with the Burisma adviser that did not appear on his official schedule, though it said any such encounter would have been "cursory". "Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague, have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official US policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing," said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr Biden. What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Biden's team has also decried the New York Post story as "Russian disinformation", though it did not say the emails were bogus. The New York Post article was shared by President Trump and his allies. Two of his former advisers, Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani, were involved in providing the story and the hard drive containing the alleged emails, to the newspaper. Mr Giuliani says the messages were found on a laptop that Hunter dropped off at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. Sceptics have noted that Mr Giuliani travelled in December 2019 to Kyiv where he met Ukrainian lawmaker Andriy Derkach, whom the US Treasury has designated as a longtime Kremlin agent. Mr Giuliani has acknowledged trying dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine. But the US Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, told Fox Business that the purported emails were not connected to a Russian disinformation effort. Other US media say they have been unable to verify the authenticity of the emails. Hunter has neither confirmed nor denied that he dropped off a laptop at the location. Hunter joined Burisma in 2014, and remained on the board until April 2019, when he decided to leave. Speaking to the BBC, he said Burisma had seen his name "as gold" and that it had played a large part in his appointment to the board. Twitter and Facebook's action over Joe Biden article reignites bias claims What are the Bidens accused of in Ukraine? Donald Trump and his allies accused Joe Biden of wrongdoing because he had pushed, while vice-president, for the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, who was investigating the company for which Hunter worked. In 2016, Joe Biden called for the dismissal of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin, whose office had Burisma and other companies under investigation. However, other Western leaders and major bodies that give financial support to Ukraine also wanted the prosecutor dismissed because they believed he was not active enough in tackling corruption. What else has the Biden campaign said? Shortly before the final presidential debate last year, the Democrat's camp released a statement denying wrongdoing. "Joe Biden has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever," said the statement. "He has never held stock in any such business arrangements nor has any family member or any other person ever held stock for him. "What is true is that Tony Bobulinski admitted on the record to Breitbart that he is angry that he was *not* able to go into business with Hunter and James Biden [Joe Biden's brother]." What did this have to do with impeachment? In 2019, details emerged of a phone call Mr Trump, the then president, had made to the president of Ukraine, in which he had urged the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens. President Trump's impeachment explained This led to charges by the Democrats that Mr Trump was trying to illegally pressure Ukraine to help damage his election rival, resulting in impeachment by the House of Representatives. Mr Trump denied he had done anything wrong, and he was later acquitted by the Republican-controlled US Senate. Getty Images President Trump holds a copy of The Washington Post the day after the US Senate acquitted him on two articles of impeachment Has anything been proven against the Bidens? While no criminal activity has been proven, it has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. A senior State Department official raised such concerns as far back as 2015. Joe Biden's son defends foreign dealings US Republican lawmakers launched an investigation and found last year that Hunter's work for the Ukrainian firm had been "problematic" - but there wasn't evidence that US foreign policy was influenced by it. No criminal charges were proven against Burisma either. The company issued a statement in 2017 saying "all legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations" against it were closed. Last year, Yuriy Lutsenko, the prosecutor in Ukraine who succeeded Viktor Shokin, told the BBC that there was no reason to investigate the Bidens under Ukrainian law. There is nothing illegal about sitting on a board of a company whilst family members serve in government. Hunter Biden's lawyers said in statement in October 2019 that he had undertaken "these business activities independently. He did not believe it appropriate to discuss them with his father, nor did he." Hunter told the New Yorker magazine that on the only occasion he had mentioned Burisma: "Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing.'" Amid all the scrutiny, Joe Biden promised last year that if he was elected president, no-one in his family would hold a job or have a business relationship with a foreign corporation or foreign government.

During the 2020 election campaign, he and his father were frequently accused by Donald Trump and his associates of wrongdoing in regards to China and Ukraine, allegations which they both denied. The New York Post reported on an alleged email in which an adviser from a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, apparently thanked Hunter for inviting him to meet his father, Joe Biden. Asked about the allegations, Joe Biden told a reporter it was a "smear campaign". No criminal activity has been proven, and no evidence has emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. In an interview with the BBC months after his father was sworn in as president, Hunter Biden defended his qualifications for the position at Burisma but added that, in retrospect, he had "missed... the perception that I would create". Claims of influence-peddling are common in Washington DC and Mr Trump's children have also been accused of conflicts of interest in lucrative business deals overseas. They, too, deny wrongdoing. What do we know about the federal investigation? The Justice Department is investigating Hunter Biden's finances including scrutinising some of his past Chinese business dealings and other transactions, a "person familiar with the matter" told The Associated Press in December . The tax investigation was launched in 2018 but Hunter Biden said he had learned about it for the first time in December 2020. Asked about the investigation by US broadcaster CBS this April, the president's son said: "I'm co-operating, completely. And I'm absolutely certain, 100% certain, that at the end of the investigation, that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing." What have the Bidens been accused of in China?

While framed by the president as addressing Hunter’s gun and tax charges, the pardon stunningly covers all crimes Hunter “committed or may have committed” from 2014 to 2023, a period covering Hunter’s questionable business dealings in Ukraine, China, and other foreign nations. In 2014, Hunter began receiving $1 million annually from Burisma, a company controlled by a Ukrainian oligarch which dealt in energy holdings, an industry with which Hunter had no relevant experience. Also, in February 2014, then-Vice-President Joe Biden dined with Russian and Kazakhstani oligarchs who were shortly thereafter responsible for millions of dollars in suspect money transfers including $142,300 which appears to have covered the cost of a car for Hunter. Rather than supporting the integrity of the legal system, by issuing this pardon, President Biden did the opposite and instead decided to put family above fairness to American taxpayers and law-abiding citizens. This is an unacceptable abuse of presidential powers. It has been said, “eternal vigilance is the price of liberty," and after the historic inflation, regulatory overreach, and failures of leadership we’ve seen throughout the Biden-Harris administration, it is clear reining in the excesses of the federal government has never been more urgent. As Republicans look forward to advancing sound policy for the American people in the coming year, we are preparing to deliver government accountability to the taxpayers, families, and small businesses which make up the backbone of our economy. This week, the office of Sen. Joni Ernst released a report showing only 6 percent of the more than two million federal employees work completely in-person rather than telework or remote work. Meanwhile, leasing, maintenance, and operations for federal office buildings costs taxpayers approximately $15.7 billion annually. This is the reason I supported the SHOW UP Act in 2023 to require federal agency employees to show up for work and get back to the business of serving the American people. Unfortunately, the bill has been ignored by Democrats in the Senate and White House. I am eager to ensure the government works more efficiently for the American people and welcome the opportunity to work toward this goal with Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and President Trump’s newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) which aims to address wasteful federal spending and bureaucratic bloat in the coming year. The IRS will be a good place for DOGE’s work to start. Overhauling the IRS requires new leadership. I applaud President Trump’s announcement of his plan to remove the current Commissioner Danny Werfel and nominate my former colleague, Billy Long to fill the role. Despite his commitments to “world-class customer service” and “to roll up [his] sleeves to help working families” during his confirmation process, Commissioner Werfel’s tenure at the IRS has instead focused on advancing the Biden-Harris agenda to intrude further into the financial privacy of American families and small businesses. We need an IRS commissioner who will restore accountability to the agency and its employees, ensure unelected bureaucrats do not harass Americans on the basis of ideology as it did under the Obama administration, simplify tax compliance, protect taxpayer data and privacy, update antiquated technology systems, return to wholly appropriated funding, end the unlawful Direct File Program, and have a true focus on serving taxpayers well. I hope Rep. Long will demonstrate his capacity to do this as the Senate considers his nomination. To combat inflation caused by overspending, clean up the morass of overregulation, and hold those entrusted with power accountable, we need to refocus and repair how the federal government serves Americans. In many ways this looks like getting Washington out of the way and allowing the American people do what they do best. President Ronald Reagan famously said, “the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government, and I'm here to help.” It’s about time we restore accountability and focus on efficiency governmentwide. ### Issues : Economy Taxes Office Locations Washington DC Office 502 Cannon HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-6435 Fax: (202) 225-0207 Nebraska City District Office 202 South 8th Street Suite A Nebraska City, NE 68410 Phone: (402) 874-6050 Fax: (402) 874-6049 Grand Island District Office 1811 West Second Street Suite 275 Grand Island, NE 68803 Phone: (308) 384-3900 Fax: (308) 384-3902 Scottsbluff District Office 416 Valley View Dr. Suite 600 Scottsbluff, NE 69361 Phone: (308) 633-6333 Fax: (308) 633-6335 Copyright Privacy House.gov Accessibility RSSICYMI: Whistleblower Docs Show Burisma Hired Hunter Biden for His “Political Weight” and Carefully Navigated His Appointment to Protect Joe Biden – Ways and Means Skip to content About The Chairman The Committee Membership Subcommittees Internships News 2025 Tax Teams Activity Hearings Markups Calendar Listening To Americans Twitter Instagram Youtube ICYMI: Whistleblower Docs Show Burisma Hired Hunter Biden for His “Political Weight” and Carefully Navigated His Appointment to Protect Joe Biden November 17, 2023 A series of spreadsheets and emails included within the over 700 pages of whistleblower documents released by Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (MO-08) last month show an alarming pattern of meetings between senior White House staff, Hunter Biden business associate Devon Archer, and Hunter Biden in the same year then-Vice President Biden made an unprecedented three official visits to Ukraine. At the same time those meetings occurred, Archer was negotiating Hunter Biden’s position on the board of directors of Burisma – a Ukrainian company – whose executives implied his value to their company was his influence with his father. They even acknowledged the sensitive optics surrounding his appointment to the company’s board, and discussed the need to make his appointment public only after then-Vice President Biden’s first official trip to Ukraine concluded. April 15, 2014: Devon Archer meets with Vice President Biden at the White House. April 16, 2014: Hunter Biden has coffee with Greg Schultz, Senior Advisor to Vice President Biden. Later that same day, Hunter Biden meets with Devon Archer at the White House. April 17, 2014: A Burisma executive emails Devon Archer stating, as it relates to Hunter Biden, “ I do believe we have to reach a reasonable balance here ” and acknowledged they were relying on Hunter Biden’s influence with his father and would take into account how to use “ the political weight of our Directors… carefully and strategically. ” The email went on to say they would list Hunter Biden on their website “ after his father left our country” and underlined how Burisma could not, “hide our directors. ” April 21, 2014: Then-Vice President Joe Biden travels to Ukraine. May 12, 2014 : Hunter Biden appointed to Burisma’s board of directors. May 13, 2014: According to emails obtained from the Hunter Biden laptop, Eric Schwerin, another Hunter Biden business associate, directed a photo of Joe Biden and Devon Archer that was taken at the April 15th White House meeting be removed from Burisma’s website at the request of the Vice President’s General Counsel. June 7, 2014: Then-Vice President Joe Biden travels to Ukraine for a second time to attend the inauguration of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. September 24, 2014: Devon Archer forwards an email to Hunter Biden discussing the need to “alert U.S. officials who might be able to influence Ukraine to not adopt such harmful measures.” October 27, 2014: Hunter Biden receives an email from a U.S. government official stating, “Secretary of State may be calling you soon.” November 20, 2014: Then-Vice President Biden visits Ukraine for a third time. December 17, 2014: Eric Schwerin emails Hunter Biden to request then-Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s email address. Chairman Smith said, “It is hard to believe the timing of Hunter Biden’s appointment to the board of Burisma and his father’s multiple official visits to Ukraine are mere coincidence. House Republicans are determined to get to the bottom of the Biden family’s influence peddling scheme, and the American people have a right to know if then-Vice President Biden used his official government position to help his family’s overseas business operations. “Thanks to the IRS whistleblowers we know President Biden lied when he said he had no knowledge and was not involved in his son’s business dealings. It now appears he in fact benefited.

Asked about the allegations, Joe Biden told a reporter it was a "smear campaign". No criminal activity has been proven, and no evidence has emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. In an interview with the BBC months after his father was sworn in as president, Hunter Biden defended his qualifications for the position at Burisma but added that, in retrospect, he had "missed... the perception that I would create". Claims of influence-peddling are common in Washington DC and Mr Trump's children have also been accused of conflicts of interest in lucrative business deals overseas. They, too, deny wrongdoing. What do we know about the federal investigation? The Justice Department is investigating Hunter Biden's finances including scrutinising some of his past Chinese business dealings and other transactions, a "person familiar with the matter" told The Associated Press in December . The tax investigation was launched in 2018 but Hunter Biden said he had learned about it for the first time in December 2020. Asked about the investigation by US broadcaster CBS this April, the president's son said: "I'm co-operating, completely. And I'm absolutely certain, 100% certain, that at the end of the investigation, that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing." What have the Bidens been accused of in China? The New York Post cited a purported email from Hunter Biden in August 2017 indicating he was receiving a $10m annual fee from a Chinese billionaire for "introductions alone", though it is unclear who was involved in the alleged introductions. Another purported email, which Fox News said it had confirmed, reportedly refers to a deal pursued by Hunter involving China's largest private energy firm. It is said to include a cryptic mention of "10 held by H for the big guy". Fox News cited unnamed sources as saying "the big guy" in the purported email was a reference to Joe Biden. This message is said to be from May 2017. Both emails would date from when the former US vice-president was a private citizen. A former business associate of Hunter Biden has come forward to say he can confirm the allegations. Tony Bobulinski told Fox News that, contrary to Joe Biden's statements that he had nothing to do with his son's business affairs, Hunter had "frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals" in China. Mr Bobulinski, who is reportedly a US Navy veteran, separately told Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he had met on two occasions with Joe Biden to discuss business deals with China, the first time in May 2017 when Barack Obama's former vice-president was a private citizen. He says he asked Joe Biden's brother, James, whether the family was concerned about possible scrutiny of the former vice-president's involvement in a potential business deal with a Chinese entity. Mr Bobulinski told Fox News that James Biden had replied: "Plausible deniability." Mr Bobulinski was invited by Mr Trump to be his guest at the final presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee on 22 October. What is known about Hunter's dealings in China? In 2013, Hunter flew aboard Air Force Two with his father, who was then vice-president, on an official visit to Beijing, where the younger Biden met investment banker Jonathan Li. Hunter told the New Yorker he had just met Mr Li for "a cup of coffee", but 12 days after the trip a private equity fund, BHR Partners, was approved by the Chinese authorities. Mr Li was chief executive and Hunter was a board member. He would hold a 10% stake. Getty Images Joe Biden walks out of Air Force Two with his granddaughter and son, Hunter Biden BHR is backed by some of China's largest state banks and by local governments, according to US media. Hunter Biden's lawyer said he had joined the board in an unpaid position "based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets". His lawyer also said his client did not acquire his financial stake in BHR until 2017, after his father had left office in the US. Hunter resigned from the board of BHR in April 2020, but still held his 10% stake in BHR as of July this year, according to the company report. What did the New York Post say about Hunter Biden and Ukraine? The New York Post reported an email from April 2015, in which an adviser to Burisma, Vadym Pozharskyi, apparently thanked Hunter Biden for inviting him to meet his father in Washington. Hunter was a director on the board of Burisma - a Ukrainian-owned private energy company while his father was the Obama administration's pointman on US-Ukrainian relations. Hunter was one of several foreigners on its board. The New York Post article did not provide evidence that the meeting had ever taken place. The Biden election campaign said there was no record of any such meeting on the former vice-president's "official schedule" from the time. But in a statement to Politico , the campaign also acknowledged that Mr Biden could have had an "informal interaction" with the Burisma adviser that did not appear on his official schedule, though it said any such encounter would have been "cursory". "Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague, have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official US policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing," said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr Biden. What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Biden's team has also decried the New York Post story as "Russian disinformation", though it did not say the emails were bogus. The New York Post article was shared by President Trump and his allies. Two of his former advisers, Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani, were involved in providing the story and the hard drive containing the alleged emails, to the newspaper. Mr Giuliani says the messages were found on a laptop that Hunter dropped off at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. Sceptics have noted that Mr Giuliani travelled in December 2019 to Kyiv where he met Ukrainian lawmaker Andriy Derkach, whom the US Treasury has designated as a longtime Kremlin agent. Mr Giuliani has acknowledged trying dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine. But the US Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, told Fox Business that the purported emails were not connected to a Russian disinformation effort. Other US media say they have been unable to verify the authenticity of the emails. Hunter has neither confirmed nor denied that he dropped off a laptop at the location. Hunter joined Burisma in 2014, and remained on the board until April 2019, when he decided to leave. Speaking to the BBC, he said Burisma had seen his name "as gold" and that it had played a large part in his appointment to the board. Twitter and Facebook's action over Joe Biden article reignites bias claims What are the Bidens accused of in Ukraine? Donald Trump and his allies accused Joe Biden of wrongdoing because he had pushed, while vice-president, for the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, who was investigating the company for which Hunter worked. In 2016, Joe Biden called for the dismissal of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin, whose office had Burisma and other companies under investigation. However, other Western leaders and major bodies that give financial support to Ukraine also wanted the prosecutor dismissed because they believed he was not active enough in tackling corruption. What else has the Biden campaign said? Shortly before the final presidential debate last year, the Democrat's camp released a statement denying wrongdoing. "Joe Biden has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever," said the statement. "He has never held stock in any such business arrangements nor has any family member or any other person ever held stock for him. "What is true is that Tony Bobulinski admitted on the record to Breitbart that he is angry that he was *not* able to go into business with Hunter and James Biden [Joe Biden's brother]." What did this have to do with impeachment? In 2019, details emerged of a phone call Mr Trump, the then president, had made to the president of Ukraine, in which he had urged the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens. President Trump's impeachment explained This led to charges by the Democrats that Mr Trump was trying to illegally pressure Ukraine to help damage his election rival, resulting in impeachment by the House of Representatives. Mr Trump denied he had done anything wrong, and he was later acquitted by the Republican-controlled US Senate. Getty Images President Trump holds a copy of The Washington Post the day after the US Senate acquitted him on two articles of impeachment Has anything been proven against the Bidens? While no criminal activity has been proven, it has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. A senior State Department official raised such concerns as far back as 2015. Joe Biden's son defends foreign dealings US Republican lawmakers launched an investigation and found last year that Hunter's work for the Ukrainian firm had been "problematic" - but there wasn't evidence that US foreign policy was influenced by it. No criminal charges were proven against Burisma either. The company issued a statement in 2017 saying "all legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations" against it were closed. Last year, Yuriy Lutsenko, the prosecutor in Ukraine who succeeded Viktor Shokin, told the BBC that there was no reason to investigate the Bidens under Ukrainian law. There is nothing illegal about sitting on a board of a company whilst family members serve in government. Hunter Biden's lawyers said in statement in October 2019 that he had undertaken "these business activities independently. He did not believe it appropriate to discuss them with his father, nor did he." Hunter told the New Yorker magazine that on the only occasion he had mentioned Burisma: "Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing.'" Amid all the scrutiny, Joe Biden promised last year that if he was elected president, no-one in his family would hold a job or have a business relationship with a foreign corporation or foreign government.

While framed by the president as addressing Hunter’s gun and tax charges, the pardon stunningly covers all crimes Hunter “committed or may have committed” from 2014 to 2023, a period covering Hunter’s questionable business dealings in Ukraine, China, and other foreign nations. In 2014, Hunter began receiving $1 million annually from Burisma, a company controlled by a Ukrainian oligarch which dealt in energy holdings, an industry with which Hunter had no relevant experience. Also, in February 2014, then-Vice-President Joe Biden dined with Russian and Kazakhstani oligarchs who were shortly thereafter responsible for millions of dollars in suspect money transfers including $142,300 which appears to have covered the cost of a car for Hunter. Rather than supporting the integrity of the legal system, by issuing this pardon, President Biden did the opposite and instead decided to put family above fairness to American taxpayers and law-abiding citizens. This is an unacceptable abuse of presidential powers. It has been said, “eternal vigilance is the price of liberty," and after the historic inflation, regulatory overreach, and failures of leadership we’ve seen throughout the Biden-Harris administration, it is clear reining in the excesses of the federal government has never been more urgent. As Republicans look forward to advancing sound policy for the American people in the coming year, we are preparing to deliver government accountability to the taxpayers, families, and small businesses which make up the backbone of our economy. This week, the office of Sen. Joni Ernst released a report showing only 6 percent of the more than two million federal employees work completely in-person rather than telework or remote work. Meanwhile, leasing, maintenance, and operations for federal office buildings costs taxpayers approximately $15.7 billion annually. This is the reason I supported the SHOW UP Act in 2023 to require federal agency employees to show up for work and get back to the business of serving the American people. Unfortunately, the bill has been ignored by Democrats in the Senate and White House. I am eager to ensure the government works more efficiently for the American people and welcome the opportunity to work toward this goal with Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and President Trump’s newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) which aims to address wasteful federal spending and bureaucratic bloat in the coming year. The IRS will be a good place for DOGE’s work to start. Overhauling the IRS requires new leadership. I applaud President Trump’s announcement of his plan to remove the current Commissioner Danny Werfel and nominate my former colleague, Billy Long to fill the role. Despite his commitments to “world-class customer service” and “to roll up [his] sleeves to help working families” during his confirmation process, Commissioner Werfel’s tenure at the IRS has instead focused on advancing the Biden-Harris agenda to intrude further into the financial privacy of American families and small businesses. We need an IRS commissioner who will restore accountability to the agency and its employees, ensure unelected bureaucrats do not harass Americans on the basis of ideology as it did under the Obama administration, simplify tax compliance, protect taxpayer data and privacy, update antiquated technology systems, return to wholly appropriated funding, end the unlawful Direct File Program, and have a true focus on serving taxpayers well. I hope Rep. Long will demonstrate his capacity to do this as the Senate considers his nomination. To combat inflation caused by overspending, clean up the morass of overregulation, and hold those entrusted with power accountable, we need to refocus and repair how the federal government serves Americans. In many ways this looks like getting Washington out of the way and allowing the American people do what they do best. President Ronald Reagan famously said, “the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government, and I'm here to help.” It’s about time we restore accountability and focus on efficiency governmentwide. ### Issues : Economy Taxes Office Locations Washington DC Office 502 Cannon HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-6435 Fax: (202) 225-0207 Nebraska City District Office 202 South 8th Street Suite A Nebraska City, NE 68410 Phone: (402) 874-6050 Fax: (402) 874-6049 Grand Island District Office 1811 West Second Street Suite 275 Grand Island, NE 68803 Phone: (308) 384-3900 Fax: (308) 384-3902 Scottsbluff District Office 416 Valley View Dr. Suite 600 Scottsbluff, NE 69361 Phone: (308) 633-6333 Fax: (308) 633-6335 Copyright Privacy House.gov Accessibility RSSICYMI: Whistleblower Docs Show Burisma Hired Hunter Biden for His “Political Weight” and Carefully Navigated His Appointment to Protect Joe Biden – Ways and Means Skip to content About The Chairman The Committee Membership Subcommittees Internships News 2025 Tax Teams Activity Hearings Markups Calendar Listening To Americans Twitter Instagram Youtube ICYMI: Whistleblower Docs Show Burisma Hired Hunter Biden for His “Political Weight” and Carefully Navigated His Appointment to Protect Joe Biden November 17, 2023 A series of spreadsheets and emails included within the over 700 pages of whistleblower documents released by Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (MO-08) last month show an alarming pattern of meetings between senior White House staff, Hunter Biden business associate Devon Archer, and Hunter Biden in the same year then-Vice President Biden made an unprecedented three official visits to Ukraine. At the same time those meetings occurred, Archer was negotiating Hunter Biden’s position on the board of directors of Burisma – a Ukrainian company – whose executives implied his value to their company was his influence with his father. They even acknowledged the sensitive optics surrounding his appointment to the company’s board, and discussed the need to make his appointment public only after then-Vice President Biden’s first official trip to Ukraine concluded. April 15, 2014: Devon Archer meets with Vice President Biden at the White House. April 16, 2014: Hunter Biden has coffee with Greg Schultz, Senior Advisor to Vice President Biden. Later that same day, Hunter Biden meets with Devon Archer at the White House. April 17, 2014: A Burisma executive emails Devon Archer stating, as it relates to Hunter Biden, “ I do believe we have to reach a reasonable balance here ” and acknowledged they were relying on Hunter Biden’s influence with his father and would take into account how to use “ the political weight of our Directors… carefully and strategically. ” The email went on to say they would list Hunter Biden on their website “ after his father left our country” and underlined how Burisma could not, “hide our directors. ” April 21, 2014: Then-Vice President Joe Biden travels to Ukraine. May 12, 2014 : Hunter Biden appointed to Burisma’s board of directors. May 13, 2014: According to emails obtained from the Hunter Biden laptop, Eric Schwerin, another Hunter Biden business associate, directed a photo of Joe Biden and Devon Archer that was taken at the April 15th White House meeting be removed from Burisma’s website at the request of the Vice President’s General Counsel. June 7, 2014: Then-Vice President Joe Biden travels to Ukraine for a second time to attend the inauguration of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. September 24, 2014: Devon Archer forwards an email to Hunter Biden discussing the need to “alert U.S. officials who might be able to influence Ukraine to not adopt such harmful measures.” October 27, 2014: Hunter Biden receives an email from a U.S. government official stating, “Secretary of State may be calling you soon.” November 20, 2014: Then-Vice President Biden visits Ukraine for a third time. December 17, 2014: Eric Schwerin emails Hunter Biden to request then-Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s email address. Chairman Smith said, “It is hard to believe the timing of Hunter Biden’s appointment to the board of Burisma and his father’s multiple official visits to Ukraine are mere coincidence. House Republicans are determined to get to the bottom of the Biden family’s influence peddling scheme, and the American people have a right to know if then-Vice President Biden used his official government position to help his family’s overseas business operations. “Thanks to the IRS whistleblowers we know President Biden lied when he said he had no knowledge and was not involved in his son’s business dealings. It now appears he in fact benefited. We will continue to follow the facts in this investigation and present the truth to the American people.” READ : Bombshell: Ways and Means Releases New Documents Revealing Hunter Biden Selling Access to White House, Investigators Blocked from Pursuing Evidence Related to President Biden READ : ICYMI: Documents Confirm Joe Biden was his Family’s “Only Asset” and “The Brand” READ : ICYMI: New Documents Link Biden Family Influence Peddling Scheme to 23 Countries, Four Continents READ : ICYMI: Hunter Biden’s Business Associates Enjoyed White House Dinners, Flights on Air Force 2 Internships Minority Subscribe Archive Privacy Policy News Twitter Instagram Youtube 1139 Longworth HOB Washington D.C. 20515 | P: (202) 225-3625ICYMI: President Trump’s Largest Tax Cut in History – The White House Menu President Donald J.

During the 2020 election campaign, he and his father were frequently accused by Donald Trump and his associates of wrongdoing in regards to China and Ukraine, allegations which they both denied. The New York Post reported on an alleged email in which an adviser from a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, apparently thanked Hunter for inviting him to meet his father, Joe Biden. Asked about the allegations, Joe Biden told a reporter it was a "smear campaign". No criminal activity has been proven, and no evidence has emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. In an interview with the BBC months after his father was sworn in as president, Hunter Biden defended his qualifications for the position at Burisma but added that, in retrospect, he had "missed... the perception that I would create". Claims of influence-peddling are common in Washington DC and Mr Trump's children have also been accused of conflicts of interest in lucrative business deals overseas. They, too, deny wrongdoing. What do we know about the federal investigation? The Justice Department is investigating Hunter Biden's finances including scrutinising some of his past Chinese business dealings and other transactions, a "person familiar with the matter" told The Associated Press in December . The tax investigation was launched in 2018 but Hunter Biden said he had learned about it for the first time in December 2020. Asked about the investigation by US broadcaster CBS this April, the president's son said: "I'm co-operating, completely. And I'm absolutely certain, 100% certain, that at the end of the investigation, that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing." What have the Bidens been accused of in China? The New York Post cited a purported email from Hunter Biden in August 2017 indicating he was receiving a $10m annual fee from a Chinese billionaire for "introductions alone", though it is unclear who was involved in the alleged introductions. Another purported email, which Fox News said it had confirmed, reportedly refers to a deal pursued by Hunter involving China's largest private energy firm. It is said to include a cryptic mention of "10 held by H for the big guy". Fox News cited unnamed sources as saying "the big guy" in the purported email was a reference to Joe Biden. This message is said to be from May 2017. Both emails would date from when the former US vice-president was a private citizen. A former business associate of Hunter Biden has come forward to say he can confirm the allegations. Tony Bobulinski told Fox News that, contrary to Joe Biden's statements that he had nothing to do with his son's business affairs, Hunter had "frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals" in China. Mr Bobulinski, who is reportedly a US Navy veteran, separately told Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he had met on two occasions with Joe Biden to discuss business deals with China, the first time in May 2017 when Barack Obama's former vice-president was a private citizen. He says he asked Joe Biden's brother, James, whether the family was concerned about possible scrutiny of the former vice-president's involvement in a potential business deal with a Chinese entity. Mr Bobulinski told Fox News that James Biden had replied: "Plausible deniability." Mr Bobulinski was invited by Mr Trump to be his guest at the final presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee on 22 October. What is known about Hunter's dealings in China? In 2013, Hunter flew aboard Air Force Two with his father, who was then vice-president, on an official visit to Beijing, where the younger Biden met investment banker Jonathan Li. Hunter told the New Yorker he had just met Mr Li for "a cup of coffee", but 12 days after the trip a private equity fund, BHR Partners, was approved by the Chinese authorities. Mr Li was chief executive and Hunter was a board member. He would hold a 10% stake. Getty Images Joe Biden walks out of Air Force Two with his granddaughter and son, Hunter Biden BHR is backed by some of China's largest state banks and by local governments, according to US media. Hunter Biden's lawyer said he had joined the board in an unpaid position "based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets". His lawyer also said his client did not acquire his financial stake in BHR until 2017, after his father had left office in the US. Hunter resigned from the board of BHR in April 2020, but still held his 10% stake in BHR as of July this year, according to the company report. What did the New York Post say about Hunter Biden and Ukraine? The New York Post reported an email from April 2015, in which an adviser to Burisma, Vadym Pozharskyi, apparently thanked Hunter Biden for inviting him to meet his father in Washington. Hunter was a director on the board of Burisma - a Ukrainian-owned private energy company while his father was the Obama administration's pointman on US-Ukrainian relations. Hunter was one of several foreigners on its board. The New York Post article did not provide evidence that the meeting had ever taken place. The Biden election campaign said there was no record of any such meeting on the former vice-president's "official schedule" from the time. But in a statement to Politico , the campaign also acknowledged that Mr Biden could have had an "informal interaction" with the Burisma adviser that did not appear on his official schedule, though it said any such encounter would have been "cursory". "Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague, have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official US policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing," said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr Biden. What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Biden's team has also decried the New York Post story as "Russian disinformation", though it did not say the emails were bogus. The New York Post article was shared by President Trump and his allies. Two of his former advisers, Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani, were involved in providing the story and the hard drive containing the alleged emails, to the newspaper. Mr Giuliani says the messages were found on a laptop that Hunter dropped off at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. Sceptics have noted that Mr Giuliani travelled in December 2019 to Kyiv where he met Ukrainian lawmaker Andriy Derkach, whom the US Treasury has designated as a longtime Kremlin agent. Mr Giuliani has acknowledged trying dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine. But the US Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, told Fox Business that the purported emails were not connected to a Russian disinformation effort. Other US media say they have been unable to verify the authenticity of the emails. Hunter has neither confirmed nor denied that he dropped off a laptop at the location. Hunter joined Burisma in 2014, and remained on the board until April 2019, when he decided to leave. Speaking to the BBC, he said Burisma had seen his name "as gold" and that it had played a large part in his appointment to the board. Twitter and Facebook's action over Joe Biden article reignites bias claims What are the Bidens accused of in Ukraine? Donald Trump and his allies accused Joe Biden of wrongdoing because he had pushed, while vice-president, for the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, who was investigating the company for which Hunter worked. In 2016, Joe Biden called for the dismissal of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin, whose office had Burisma and other companies under investigation. However, other Western leaders and major bodies that give financial support to Ukraine also wanted the prosecutor dismissed because they believed he was not active enough in tackling corruption. What else has the Biden campaign said? Shortly before the final presidential debate last year, the Democrat's camp released a statement denying wrongdoing. "Joe Biden has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever," said the statement. "He has never held stock in any such business arrangements nor has any family member or any other person ever held stock for him. "What is true is that Tony Bobulinski admitted on the record to Breitbart that he is angry that he was *not* able to go into business with Hunter and James Biden [Joe Biden's brother]." What did this have to do with impeachment? In 2019, details emerged of a phone call Mr Trump, the then president, had made to the president of Ukraine, in which he had urged the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens. President Trump's impeachment explained This led to charges by the Democrats that Mr Trump was trying to illegally pressure Ukraine to help damage his election rival, resulting in impeachment by the House of Representatives. Mr Trump denied he had done anything wrong, and he was later acquitted by the Republican-controlled US Senate. Getty Images President Trump holds a copy of The Washington Post the day after the US Senate acquitted him on two articles of impeachment Has anything been proven against the Bidens? While no criminal activity has been proven, it has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. A senior State Department official raised such concerns as far back as 2015. Joe Biden's son defends foreign dealings US Republican lawmakers launched an investigation and found last year that Hunter's work for the Ukrainian firm had been "problematic" - but there wasn't evidence that US foreign policy was influenced by it. No criminal charges were proven against Burisma either. The company issued a statement in 2017 saying "all legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations" against it were closed. Last year, Yuriy Lutsenko, the prosecutor in Ukraine who succeeded Viktor Shokin, told the BBC that there was no reason to investigate the Bidens under Ukrainian law. There is nothing illegal about sitting on a board of a company whilst family members serve in government. Hunter Biden's lawyers said in statement in October 2019 that he had undertaken "these business activities independently. He did not believe it appropriate to discuss them with his father, nor did he." Hunter told the New Yorker magazine that on the only occasion he had mentioned Burisma: "Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing.'" Amid all the scrutiny, Joe Biden promised last year that if he was elected president, no-one in his family would hold a job or have a business relationship with a foreign corporation or foreign government.

While framed by the president as addressing Hunter’s gun and tax charges, the pardon stunningly covers all crimes Hunter “committed or may have committed” from 2014 to 2023, a period covering Hunter’s questionable business dealings in Ukraine, China, and other foreign nations. In 2014, Hunter began receiving $1 million annually from Burisma, a company controlled by a Ukrainian oligarch which dealt in energy holdings, an industry with which Hunter had no relevant experience. Also, in February 2014, then-Vice-President Joe Biden dined with Russian and Kazakhstani oligarchs who were shortly thereafter responsible for millions of dollars in suspect money transfers including $142,300 which appears to have covered the cost of a car for Hunter. Rather than supporting the integrity of the legal system, by issuing this pardon, President Biden did the opposite and instead decided to put family above fairness to American taxpayers and law-abiding citizens. This is an unacceptable abuse of presidential powers. It has been said, “eternal vigilance is the price of liberty," and after the historic inflation, regulatory overreach, and failures of leadership we’ve seen throughout the Biden-Harris administration, it is clear reining in the excesses of the federal government has never been more urgent. As Republicans look forward to advancing sound policy for the American people in the coming year, we are preparing to deliver government accountability to the taxpayers, families, and small businesses which make up the backbone of our economy. This week, the office of Sen. Joni Ernst released a report showing only 6 percent of the more than two million federal employees work completely in-person rather than telework or remote work. Meanwhile, leasing, maintenance, and operations for federal office buildings costs taxpayers approximately $15.7 billion annually. This is the reason I supported the SHOW UP Act in 2023 to require federal agency employees to show up for work and get back to the business of serving the American people. Unfortunately, the bill has been ignored by Democrats in the Senate and White House. I am eager to ensure the government works more efficiently for the American people and welcome the opportunity to work toward this goal with Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and President Trump’s newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) which aims to address wasteful federal spending and bureaucratic bloat in the coming year. The IRS will be a good place for DOGE’s work to start. Overhauling the IRS requires new leadership. I applaud President Trump’s announcement of his plan to remove the current Commissioner Danny Werfel and nominate my former colleague, Billy Long to fill the role. Despite his commitments to “world-class customer service” and “to roll up [his] sleeves to help working families” during his confirmation process, Commissioner Werfel’s tenure at the IRS has instead focused on advancing the Biden-Harris agenda to intrude further into the financial privacy of American families and small businesses. We need an IRS commissioner who will restore accountability to the agency and its employees, ensure unelected bureaucrats do not harass Americans on the basis of ideology as it did under the Obama administration, simplify tax compliance, protect taxpayer data and privacy, update antiquated technology systems, return to wholly appropriated funding, end the unlawful Direct File Program, and have a true focus on serving taxpayers well. I hope Rep. Long will demonstrate his capacity to do this as the Senate considers his nomination. To combat inflation caused by overspending, clean up the morass of overregulation, and hold those entrusted with power accountable, we need to refocus and repair how the federal government serves Americans. In many ways this looks like getting Washington out of the way and allowing the American people do what they do best. President Ronald Reagan famously said, “the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government, and I'm here to help.” It’s about time we restore accountability and focus on efficiency governmentwide. ### Issues : Economy Taxes Office Locations Washington DC Office 502 Cannon HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-6435 Fax: (202) 225-0207 Nebraska City District Office 202 South 8th Street Suite A Nebraska City, NE 68410 Phone: (402) 874-6050 Fax: (402) 874-6049 Grand Island District Office 1811 West Second Street Suite 275 Grand Island, NE 68803 Phone: (308) 384-3900 Fax: (308) 384-3902 Scottsbluff District Office 416 Valley View Dr. Suite 600 Scottsbluff, NE 69361 Phone: (308) 633-6333 Fax: (308) 633-6335 Copyright Privacy House.gov Accessibility RSSICYMI: Whistleblower Docs Show Burisma Hired Hunter Biden for His “Political Weight” and Carefully Navigated His Appointment to Protect Joe Biden – Ways and Means Skip to content About The Chairman The Committee Membership Subcommittees Internships News 2025 Tax Teams Activity Hearings Markups Calendar Listening To Americans Twitter Instagram Youtube ICYMI: Whistleblower Docs Show Burisma Hired Hunter Biden for His “Political Weight” and Carefully Navigated His Appointment to Protect Joe Biden November 17, 2023 A series of spreadsheets and emails included within the over 700 pages of whistleblower documents released by Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (MO-08) last month show an alarming pattern of meetings between senior White House staff, Hunter Biden business associate Devon Archer, and Hunter Biden in the same year then-Vice President Biden made an unprecedented three official visits to Ukraine. At the same time those meetings occurred, Archer was negotiating Hunter Biden’s position on the board of directors of Burisma – a Ukrainian company – whose executives implied his value to their company was his influence with his father. They even acknowledged the sensitive optics surrounding his appointment to the company’s board, and discussed the need to make his appointment public only after then-Vice President Biden’s first official trip to Ukraine concluded. April 15, 2014: Devon Archer meets with Vice President Biden at the White House. April 16, 2014: Hunter Biden has coffee with Greg Schultz, Senior Advisor to Vice President Biden. Later that same day, Hunter Biden meets with Devon Archer at the White House. April 17, 2014: A Burisma executive emails Devon Archer stating, as it relates to Hunter Biden, “ I do believe we have to reach a reasonable balance here ” and acknowledged they were relying on Hunter Biden’s influence with his father and would take into account how to use “ the political weight of our Directors… carefully and strategically. ” The email went on to say they would list Hunter Biden on their website “ after his father left our country” and underlined how Burisma could not, “hide our directors. ” April 21, 2014: Then-Vice President Joe Biden travels to Ukraine. May 12, 2014 : Hunter Biden appointed to Burisma’s board of directors. May 13, 2014: According to emails obtained from the Hunter Biden laptop, Eric Schwerin, another Hunter Biden business associate, directed a photo of Joe Biden and Devon Archer that was taken at the April 15th White House meeting be removed from Burisma’s website at the request of the Vice President’s General Counsel. June 7, 2014: Then-Vice President Joe Biden travels to Ukraine for a second time to attend the inauguration of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. September 24, 2014: Devon Archer forwards an email to Hunter Biden discussing the need to “alert U.S. officials who might be able to influence Ukraine to not adopt such harmful measures.” October 27, 2014: Hunter Biden receives an email from a U.S. government official stating, “Secretary of State may be calling you soon.” November 20, 2014: Then-Vice President Biden visits Ukraine for a third time. December 17, 2014: Eric Schwerin emails Hunter Biden to request then-Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s email address. Chairman Smith said, “It is hard to believe the timing of Hunter Biden’s appointment to the board of Burisma and his father’s multiple official visits to Ukraine are mere coincidence. House Republicans are determined to get to the bottom of the Biden family’s influence peddling scheme, and the American people have a right to know if then-Vice President Biden used his official government position to help his family’s overseas business operations. “Thanks to the IRS whistleblowers we know President Biden lied when he said he had no knowledge and was not involved in his son’s business dealings. It now appears he in fact benefited. We will continue to follow the facts in this investigation and present the truth to the American people.” READ : Bombshell: Ways and Means Releases New Documents Revealing Hunter Biden Selling Access to White House, Investigators Blocked from Pursuing Evidence Related to President Biden READ : ICYMI: Documents Confirm Joe Biden was his Family’s “Only Asset” and “The Brand” READ : ICYMI: New Documents Link Biden Family Influence Peddling Scheme to 23 Countries, Four Continents READ : ICYMI: Hunter Biden’s Business Associates Enjoyed White House Dinners, Flights on Air Force 2 Internships Minority Subscribe Archive Privacy Policy News Twitter Instagram Youtube 1139 Longworth HOB Washington D.C. 20515 | P: (202) 225-3625ICYMI: President Trump’s Largest Tax Cut in History – The White House Menu President Donald J.

Verdict One correct, two incorrect Source Kenya’s former prime minister Raila Odinga (August 2020) This article is more than 4 years old Since 2004 Nigeria’s revenue sharing formula has given 52.68% to the federal government, 26.72% to states and 20.60% to local governments. Odinga was correct about local governments’ share, but wide of the mark for the other two government levels. And experts question his claim that Nigeria’s system “works perfectly well”. After months of an often fractious stalemate , in September 2020 Kenya’s senate hammered out a deal on how revenue would be shared between the country’s two levels of government. In August, at the height of the deadlock, former prime minister Odinga returned to a familiar talking point to argue for establishing a third tier of government. Building on this in an interview with Citizen TV , Odinga, who is also an African Union envoy , said Kenya could solve the recurring battle over how to share revenue if it looked to Nigeria for lessons. Nigeria, he said, had a local, state and federal system of government. “In terms of revenue share, 20% of the revenue goes to the local, 35% goes to the state and 45% goes to the federal governments ... and it works perfectly well,” Odinga said . We checked if he was on the mark about how revenue is shared in Africa’s largest economy . Claim In Nigeria … in terms of revenue share, 20% goes to the local government. Verdict correct We asked Dennis Onyango, Odinga’s spokesperson, for the source of the former leader’s claims. We will update this report with his response. In line with its constitution , Nigeria has a federal capital authority, 36 states and 768 local government authorities. There are also six area councils. The Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission proposes a formula for how revenue is to be shared between the three levels. This is then approved by the national assembly . The revenue formula was first used in 1982 when the Nigeria Revenue Allocation Act came into effect. The law stipulated that 56% of funds would go to the federal government, 24% to states and 20% to local governments. The current formula can be traced to a March 2004 circular from the finance ministry. It has remained at these levels since. “The revenue allocation formula is still 52.68%, 26.72% and 20.6%,” Prof Sherifdeen Tella, professor of economics at Olabisi Onabanjo University told Africa Check. Before the revenue is split an amount “not less than 13%” is deducted and shared among the oil producing states based on their production levels. According to data from Nigeria's extractive industries transparency initiative , a government agency supervised by the president’s office, local governments get 20.6% of national revenue. We therefore rate Odinga as correct on this claim. Recent local government allocations at 20% The most recent full year data from the budget office shows that in 2019, local governments received N1.04 trillion of the N5.05 trillion available for sharing among the three levels of government. And in the first quarter of 2020, local governments got N441.44 billion of the N2.14 trillion available. Both these amounts work out to about 20% for local governments. (Note: Value-added tax is also shared among the three levels of government, using a different formula. Local governments get 35% of VAT revenue, state governments 50% and the federal government 15%.) Claim 35% of revenue goes to states. Verdict incorrect Data from Nigeria's extractive industries transparency initiative shows that 26.72% is reserved for the state governments, not the 35% Odinga claimed. We therefore rate this claim as incorrect. In 2019, of the N5.05 trillion available for sharing, states got N1.35 trillion. In the first quarter of 2020, states received N572.59 billion of the N2.14 trillion available. Both these allocations work out to 26.72%, in keeping with the formula. Claim 45% of revenue goes to the federal governments. Verdict incorrect Odinga’s claim of 45% is not accurate. Official data shows the federal government gets more than half of the total revenue. In 2019, data from the budget office shows the federal government received N2.66 trillion of the N5.05 trillion available for sharing. In the first quarter of 2020 it got N1.13 trillion out of N2.14 trillion. These amounts tally with the 52.68% set out in the sharing formula. Does Nigeria’s revenue sharing model work ‘perfectly well’? Raila Odinga’s assertion that the Nigerian revenue sharing formula “works perfectly” is contested. Gazie Okpara , a professor of marketing at Abia State University in southeast Nigeria whose interests include social policy, said the formula was imperfect because how the funds were spent was not transparent. “Each level of government should always give an account of how funds were spent,” he said, an audit that should be provided for in the constitution. Prof Sherifdeen Tella, a professor of economics at Olabisi Onabanjo University in southwestern Nigeria, told Africa Check that in his view, allocations to state and local governments, and especially the former, should be increased. “What is allocated to these two tiers of government is not sufficient.” Matthew Akintayo is a professor at the University of Ibadan , also in southwestern Nigeria. One of his focus areas is the economics of education. He told Africa Check that the sharing formula should be restructured. “A bulk or vast fraction of resources should be allocated to the state and local government because both arms of government are closer to the grassroots,” he said. He added that state governors should be given more leeway to manage their resources. John Kinuthia, a senior programme officer at the International Budget Partnership , told Africa Check that Odinga should also have considered the nature of devolved functions when drawing comparisons. It was difficult to compare Kenyan counties with Nigerian states, partly because they had different functions, Kinuthia said. He gave the example of education. “In Nigeria there are functions like education that are devolved, which is why you see a bigger proportion of resources at the subnational level compared to Kenya. In Kenya, education is still at the national level.” Republish our content for free We believe that everyone needs the facts.

During the 2020 election campaign, he and his father were frequently accused by Donald Trump and his associates of wrongdoing in regards to China and Ukraine, allegations which they both denied. The New York Post reported on an alleged email in which an adviser from a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, apparently thanked Hunter for inviting him to meet his father, Joe Biden. Asked about the allegations, Joe Biden told a reporter it was a "smear campaign". No criminal activity has been proven, and no evidence has emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. In an interview with the BBC months after his father was sworn in as president, Hunter Biden defended his qualifications for the position at Burisma but added that, in retrospect, he had "missed... the perception that I would create". Claims of influence-peddling are common in Washington DC and Mr Trump's children have also been accused of conflicts of interest in lucrative business deals overseas. They, too, deny wrongdoing. What do we know about the federal investigation? The Justice Department is investigating Hunter Biden's finances including scrutinising some of his past Chinese business dealings and other transactions, a "person familiar with the matter" told The Associated Press in December . The tax investigation was launched in 2018 but Hunter Biden said he had learned about it for the first time in December 2020. Asked about the investigation by US broadcaster CBS this April, the president's son said: "I'm co-operating, completely. And I'm absolutely certain, 100% certain, that at the end of the investigation, that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing." What have the Bidens been accused of in China? The New York Post cited a purported email from Hunter Biden in August 2017 indicating he was receiving a $10m annual fee from a Chinese billionaire for "introductions alone", though it is unclear who was involved in the alleged introductions. Another purported email, which Fox News said it had confirmed, reportedly refers to a deal pursued by Hunter involving China's largest private energy firm. It is said to include a cryptic mention of "10 held by H for the big guy". Fox News cited unnamed sources as saying "the big guy" in the purported email was a reference to Joe Biden. This message is said to be from May 2017. Both emails would date from when the former US vice-president was a private citizen. A former business associate of Hunter Biden has come forward to say he can confirm the allegations. Tony Bobulinski told Fox News that, contrary to Joe Biden's statements that he had nothing to do with his son's business affairs, Hunter had "frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals" in China. Mr Bobulinski, who is reportedly a US Navy veteran, separately told Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he had met on two occasions with Joe Biden to discuss business deals with China, the first time in May 2017 when Barack Obama's former vice-president was a private citizen. He says he asked Joe Biden's brother, James, whether the family was concerned about possible scrutiny of the former vice-president's involvement in a potential business deal with a Chinese entity. Mr Bobulinski told Fox News that James Biden had replied: "Plausible deniability." Mr Bobulinski was invited by Mr Trump to be his guest at the final presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee on 22 October. What is known about Hunter's dealings in China? In 2013, Hunter flew aboard Air Force Two with his father, who was then vice-president, on an official visit to Beijing, where the younger Biden met investment banker Jonathan Li. Hunter told the New Yorker he had just met Mr Li for "a cup of coffee", but 12 days after the trip a private equity fund, BHR Partners, was approved by the Chinese authorities. Mr Li was chief executive and Hunter was a board member. He would hold a 10% stake.

Hunter Biden's lawyer said he had joined the board in an unpaid position "based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets". His lawyer also said his client did not acquire his financial stake in BHR until 2017, after his father had left office in the US. Hunter resigned from the board of BHR in April 2020, but still held his 10% stake in BHR as of July this year, according to the company report. What did the New York Post say about Hunter Biden and Ukraine? The New York Post reported an email from April 2015, in which an adviser to Burisma, Vadym Pozharskyi, apparently thanked Hunter Biden for inviting him to meet his father in Washington. Hunter was a director on the board of Burisma - a Ukrainian-owned private energy company while his father was the Obama administration's pointman on US-Ukrainian relations. Hunter was one of several foreigners on its board. The New York Post article did not provide evidence that the meeting had ever taken place. The Biden election campaign said there was no record of any such meeting on the former vice-president's "official schedule" from the time. But in a statement to Politico , the campaign also acknowledged that Mr Biden could have had an "informal interaction" with the Burisma adviser that did not appear on his official schedule, though it said any such encounter would have been "cursory". "Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague, have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official US policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing," said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr Biden. What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Biden's team has also decried the New York Post story as "Russian disinformation", though it did not say the emails were bogus. The New York Post article was shared by President Trump and his allies. Two of his former advisers, Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani, were involved in providing the story and the hard drive containing the alleged emails, to the newspaper. Mr Giuliani says the messages were found on a laptop that Hunter dropped off at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. Sceptics have noted that Mr Giuliani travelled in December 2019 to Kyiv where he met Ukrainian lawmaker Andriy Derkach, whom the US Treasury has designated as a longtime Kremlin agent. Mr Giuliani has acknowledged trying dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine. But the US Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, told Fox Business that the purported emails were not connected to a Russian disinformation effort. Other US media say they have been unable to verify the authenticity of the emails. Hunter has neither confirmed nor denied that he dropped off a laptop at the location. Hunter joined Burisma in 2014, and remained on the board until April 2019, when he decided to leave. Speaking to the BBC, he said Burisma had seen his name "as gold" and that it had played a large part in his appointment to the board. Twitter and Facebook's action over Joe Biden article reignites bias claims What are the Bidens accused of in Ukraine? Donald Trump and his allies accused Joe Biden of wrongdoing because he had pushed, while vice-president, for the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, who was investigating the company for which Hunter worked. In 2016, Joe Biden called for the dismissal of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin, whose office had Burisma and other companies under investigation. However, other Western leaders and major bodies that give financial support to Ukraine also wanted the prosecutor dismissed because they believed he was not active enough in tackling corruption. What else has the Biden campaign said? Shortly before the final presidential debate last year, the Democrat's camp released a statement denying wrongdoing. "Joe Biden has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever," said the statement. "He has never held stock in any such business arrangements nor has any family member or any other person ever held stock for him. "What is true is that Tony Bobulinski admitted on the record to Breitbart that he is angry that he was *not* able to go into business with Hunter and James Biden [Joe Biden's brother]." What did this have to do with impeachment? In 2019, details emerged of a phone call Mr Trump, the then president, had made to the president of Ukraine, in which he had urged the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens. President Trump's impeachment explained This led to charges by the Democrats that Mr Trump was trying to illegally pressure Ukraine to help damage his election rival, resulting in impeachment by the House of Representatives. Mr Trump denied he had done anything wrong, and he was later acquitted by the Republican-controlled US Senate. Getty Images President Trump holds a copy of The Washington Post the day after the US Senate acquitted him on two articles of impeachment Has anything been proven against the Bidens? While no criminal activity has been proven, it has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. A senior State Department official raised such concerns as far back as 2015. Joe Biden's son defends foreign dealings US Republican lawmakers launched an investigation and found last year that Hunter's work for the Ukrainian firm had been "problematic" - but there wasn't evidence that US foreign policy was influenced by it. No criminal charges were proven against Burisma either. The company issued a statement in 2017 saying "all legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations" against it were closed. Last year, Yuriy Lutsenko, the prosecutor in Ukraine who succeeded Viktor Shokin, told the BBC that there was no reason to investigate the Bidens under Ukrainian law. There is nothing illegal about sitting on a board of a company whilst family members serve in government. Hunter Biden's lawyers said in statement in October 2019 that he had undertaken "these business activities independently. He did not believe it appropriate to discuss them with his father, nor did he." Hunter told the New Yorker magazine that on the only occasion he had mentioned Burisma: "Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing.'" Amid all the scrutiny, Joe Biden promised last year that if he was elected president, no-one in his family would hold a job or have a business relationship with a foreign corporation or foreign government.

During the 2020 election campaign, he and his father were frequently accused by Donald Trump and his associates of wrongdoing in regards to China and Ukraine, allegations which they both denied. The New York Post reported on an alleged email in which an adviser from a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, apparently thanked Hunter for inviting him to meet his father, Joe Biden. Asked about the allegations, Joe Biden told a reporter it was a "smear campaign". No criminal activity has been proven, and no evidence has emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. In an interview with the BBC months after his father was sworn in as president, Hunter Biden defended his qualifications for the position at Burisma but added that, in retrospect, he had "missed... the perception that I would create". Claims of influence-peddling are common in Washington DC and Mr Trump's children have also been accused of conflicts of interest in lucrative business deals overseas. They, too, deny wrongdoing. What do we know about the federal investigation? The Justice Department is investigating Hunter Biden's finances including scrutinising some of his past Chinese business dealings and other transactions, a "person familiar with the matter" told The Associated Press in December . The tax investigation was launched in 2018 but Hunter Biden said he had learned about it for the first time in December 2020. Asked about the investigation by US broadcaster CBS this April, the president's son said: "I'm co-operating, completely. And I'm absolutely certain, 100% certain, that at the end of the investigation, that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing." What have the Bidens been accused of in China? The New York Post cited a purported email from Hunter Biden in August 2017 indicating he was receiving a $10m annual fee from a Chinese billionaire for "introductions alone", though it is unclear who was involved in the alleged introductions. Another purported email, which Fox News said it had confirmed, reportedly refers to a deal pursued by Hunter involving China's largest private energy firm. It is said to include a cryptic mention of "10 held by H for the big guy". Fox News cited unnamed sources as saying "the big guy" in the purported email was a reference to Joe Biden. This message is said to be from May 2017. Both emails would date from when the former US vice-president was a private citizen. A former business associate of Hunter Biden has come forward to say he can confirm the allegations. Tony Bobulinski told Fox News that, contrary to Joe Biden's statements that he had nothing to do with his son's business affairs, Hunter had "frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals" in China. Mr Bobulinski, who is reportedly a US Navy veteran, separately told Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he had met on two occasions with Joe Biden to discuss business deals with China, the first time in May 2017 when Barack Obama's former vice-president was a private citizen. He says he asked Joe Biden's brother, James, whether the family was concerned about possible scrutiny of the former vice-president's involvement in a potential business deal with a Chinese entity. Mr Bobulinski told Fox News that James Biden had replied: "Plausible deniability." Mr Bobulinski was invited by Mr Trump to be his guest at the final presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee on 22 October. What is known about Hunter's dealings in China? In 2013, Hunter flew aboard Air Force Two with his father, who was then vice-president, on an official visit to Beijing, where the younger Biden met investment banker Jonathan Li. Hunter told the New Yorker he had just met Mr Li for "a cup of coffee", but 12 days after the trip a private equity fund, BHR Partners, was approved by the Chinese authorities. Mr Li was chief executive and Hunter was a board member. He would hold a 10% stake.

While framed by the president as addressing Hunter’s gun and tax charges, the pardon stunningly covers all crimes Hunter “committed or may have committed” from 2014 to 2023, a period covering Hunter’s questionable business dealings in Ukraine, China, and other foreign nations. In 2014, Hunter began receiving $1 million annually from Burisma, a company controlled by a Ukrainian oligarch which dealt in energy holdings, an industry with which Hunter had no relevant experience. Also, in February 2014, then-Vice-President Joe Biden dined with Russian and Kazakhstani oligarchs who were shortly thereafter responsible for millions of dollars in suspect money transfers including $142,300 which appears to have covered the cost of a car for Hunter. Rather than supporting the integrity of the legal system, by issuing this pardon, President Biden did the opposite and instead decided to put family above fairness to American taxpayers and law-abiding citizens. This is an unacceptable abuse of presidential powers. It has been said, “eternal vigilance is the price of liberty," and after the historic inflation, regulatory overreach, and failures of leadership we’ve seen throughout the Biden-Harris administration, it is clear reining in the excesses of the federal government has never been more urgent. As Republicans look forward to advancing sound policy for the American people in the coming year, we are preparing to deliver government accountability to the taxpayers, families, and small businesses which make up the backbone of our economy. This week, the office of Sen. Joni Ernst released a report showing only 6 percent of the more than two million federal employees work completely in-person rather than telework or remote work. Meanwhile, leasing, maintenance, and operations for federal office buildings costs taxpayers approximately $15.7 billion annually. This is the reason I supported the SHOW UP Act in 2023 to require federal agency employees to show up for work and get back to the business of serving the American people. Unfortunately, the bill has been ignored by Democrats in the Senate and White House. I am eager to ensure the government works more efficiently for the American people and welcome the opportunity to work toward this goal with Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and President Trump’s newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) which aims to address wasteful federal spending and bureaucratic bloat in the coming year. The IRS will be a good place for DOGE’s work to start. Overhauling the IRS requires new leadership. I applaud President Trump’s announcement of his plan to remove the current Commissioner Danny Werfel and nominate my former colleague, Billy Long to fill the role. Despite his commitments to “world-class customer service” and “to roll up [his] sleeves to help working families” during his confirmation process, Commissioner Werfel’s tenure at the IRS has instead focused on advancing the Biden-Harris agenda to intrude further into the financial privacy of American families and small businesses. We need an IRS commissioner who will restore accountability to the agency and its employees, ensure unelected bureaucrats do not harass Americans on the basis of ideology as it did under the Obama administration, simplify tax compliance, protect taxpayer data and privacy, update antiquated technology systems, return to wholly appropriated funding, end the unlawful Direct File Program, and have a true focus on serving taxpayers well. I hope Rep. Long will demonstrate his capacity to do this as the Senate considers his nomination. To combat inflation caused by overspending, clean up the morass of overregulation, and hold those entrusted with power accountable, we need to refocus and repair how the federal government serves Americans. In many ways this looks like getting Washington out of the way and allowing the American people do what they do best. President Ronald Reagan famously said, “the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government, and I'm here to help.” It’s about time we restore accountability and focus on efficiency governmentwide. ### Issues : Economy Taxes Office Locations Washington DC Office 502 Cannon HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-6435 Fax: (202) 225-0207 Nebraska City District Office 202 South 8th Street Suite A Nebraska City, NE 68410 Phone: (402) 874-6050 Fax: (402) 874-6049 Grand Island District Office 1811 West Second Street Suite 275 Grand Island, NE 68803 Phone: (308) 384-3900 Fax: (308) 384-3902 Scottsbluff District Office 416 Valley View Dr. Suite 600 Scottsbluff, NE 69361 Phone: (308) 633-6333 Fax: (308) 633-6335 Copyright Privacy House.gov Accessibility RSSICYMI: Whistleblower Docs Show Burisma Hired Hunter Biden for His “Political Weight” and Carefully Navigated His Appointment to Protect Joe Biden – Ways and Means Skip to content About The Chairman The Committee Membership Subcommittees Internships News 2025 Tax Teams Activity Hearings Markups Calendar Listening To Americans Twitter Instagram Youtube ICYMI: Whistleblower Docs Show Burisma Hired Hunter Biden for His “Political Weight” and Carefully Navigated His Appointment to Protect Joe Biden November 17, 2023 A series of spreadsheets and emails included within the over 700 pages of whistleblower documents released by Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (MO-08) last month show an alarming pattern of meetings between senior White House staff, Hunter Biden business associate Devon Archer, and Hunter Biden in the same year then-Vice President Biden made an unprecedented three official visits to Ukraine. At the same time those meetings occurred, Archer was negotiating Hunter Biden’s position on the board of directors of Burisma – a Ukrainian company – whose executives implied his value to their company was his influence with his father. They even acknowledged the sensitive optics surrounding his appointment to the company’s board, and discussed the need to make his appointment public only after then-Vice President Biden’s first official trip to Ukraine concluded. April 15, 2014: Devon Archer meets with Vice President Biden at the White House. April 16, 2014: Hunter Biden has coffee with Greg Schultz, Senior Advisor to Vice President Biden. Later that same day, Hunter Biden meets with Devon Archer at the White House. April 17, 2014: A Burisma executive emails Devon Archer stating, as it relates to Hunter Biden, “ I do believe we have to reach a reasonable balance here ” and acknowledged they were relying on Hunter Biden’s influence with his father and would take into account how to use “ the political weight of our Directors… carefully and strategically. ” The email went on to say they would list Hunter Biden on their website “ after his father left our country” and underlined how Burisma could not, “hide our directors. ” April 21, 2014: Then-Vice President Joe Biden travels to Ukraine. May 12, 2014 : Hunter Biden appointed to Burisma’s board of directors. May 13, 2014: According to emails obtained from the Hunter Biden laptop, Eric Schwerin, another Hunter Biden business associate, directed a photo of Joe Biden and Devon Archer that was taken at the April 15th White House meeting be removed from Burisma’s website at the request of the Vice President’s General Counsel. June 7, 2014: Then-Vice President Joe Biden travels to Ukraine for a second time to attend the inauguration of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. September 24, 2014: Devon Archer forwards an email to Hunter Biden discussing the need to “alert U.S. officials who might be able to influence Ukraine to not adopt such harmful measures.” October 27, 2014: Hunter Biden receives an email from a U.S. government official stating, “Secretary of State may be calling you soon.” November 20, 2014: Then-Vice President Biden visits Ukraine for a third time. December 17, 2014: Eric Schwerin emails Hunter Biden to request then-Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s email address. Chairman Smith said, “It is hard to believe the timing of Hunter Biden’s appointment to the board of Burisma and his father’s multiple official visits to Ukraine are mere coincidence. House Republicans are determined to get to the bottom of the Biden family’s influence peddling scheme, and the American people have a right to know if then-Vice President Biden used his official government position to help his family’s overseas business operations. “Thanks to the IRS whistleblowers we know President Biden lied when he said he had no knowledge and was not involved in his son’s business dealings. It now appears he in fact benefited. We will continue to follow the facts in this investigation and present the truth to the American people.” READ : Bombshell: Ways and Means Releases New Documents Revealing Hunter Biden Selling Access to White House, Investigators Blocked from Pursuing Evidence Related to President Biden READ : ICYMI: Documents Confirm Joe Biden was his Family’s “Only Asset” and “The Brand” READ : ICYMI: New Documents Link Biden Family Influence Peddling Scheme to 23 Countries, Four Continents READ : ICYMI: Hunter Biden’s Business Associates Enjoyed White House Dinners, Flights on Air Force 2 Internships Minority Subscribe Archive Privacy Policy News Twitter Instagram Youtube 1139 Longworth HOB Washington D.C. 20515 | P: (202) 225-3625Hunter Biden: What was he doing in China and Ukraine?

Tony Bobulinski told Fox News that, contrary to Joe Biden's statements that he had nothing to do with his son's business affairs, Hunter had "frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals" in China. Mr Bobulinski, who is reportedly a US Navy veteran, separately told Fox News' Tucker Carlson that he had met on two occasions with Joe Biden to discuss business deals with China, the first time in May 2017 when Barack Obama's former vice-president was a private citizen. He says he asked Joe Biden's brother, James, whether the family was concerned about possible scrutiny of the former vice-president's involvement in a potential business deal with a Chinese entity. Mr Bobulinski told Fox News that James Biden had replied: "Plausible deniability." Mr Bobulinski was invited by Mr Trump to be his guest at the final presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee on 22 October. What is known about Hunter's dealings in China? In 2013, Hunter flew aboard Air Force Two with his father, who was then vice-president, on an official visit to Beijing, where the younger Biden met investment banker Jonathan Li. Hunter told the New Yorker he had just met Mr Li for "a cup of coffee", but 12 days after the trip a private equity fund, BHR Partners, was approved by the Chinese authorities. Mr Li was chief executive and Hunter was a board member. He would hold a 10% stake. Getty Images Joe Biden walks out of Air Force Two with his granddaughter and son, Hunter Biden BHR is backed by some of China's largest state banks and by local governments, according to US media. Hunter Biden's lawyer said he had joined the board in an unpaid position "based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets". His lawyer also said his client did not acquire his financial stake in BHR until 2017, after his father had left office in the US. Hunter resigned from the board of BHR in April 2020, but still held his 10% stake in BHR as of July this year, according to the company report. What did the New York Post say about Hunter Biden and Ukraine? The New York Post reported an email from April 2015, in which an adviser to Burisma, Vadym Pozharskyi, apparently thanked Hunter Biden for inviting him to meet his father in Washington. Hunter was a director on the board of Burisma - a Ukrainian-owned private energy company while his father was the Obama administration's pointman on US-Ukrainian relations. Hunter was one of several foreigners on its board. The New York Post article did not provide evidence that the meeting had ever taken place. The Biden election campaign said there was no record of any such meeting on the former vice-president's "official schedule" from the time. But in a statement to Politico , the campaign also acknowledged that Mr Biden could have had an "informal interaction" with the Burisma adviser that did not appear on his official schedule, though it said any such encounter would have been "cursory". "Investigations by the press, during impeachment, and even by two Republican-led Senate committees whose work was decried as 'not legitimate' and political by a GOP colleague, have all reached the same conclusion: that Joe Biden carried out official US policy toward Ukraine and engaged in no wrongdoing," said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr Biden. What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims Mr Biden's team has also decried the New York Post story as "Russian disinformation", though it did not say the emails were bogus. The New York Post article was shared by President Trump and his allies. Two of his former advisers, Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani, were involved in providing the story and the hard drive containing the alleged emails, to the newspaper. Mr Giuliani says the messages were found on a laptop that Hunter dropped off at a Delaware repair shop in April 2019. Sceptics have noted that Mr Giuliani travelled in December 2019 to Kyiv where he met Ukrainian lawmaker Andriy Derkach, whom the US Treasury has designated as a longtime Kremlin agent. Mr Giuliani has acknowledged trying dig up dirt on the Bidens in Ukraine. But the US Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, told Fox Business that the purported emails were not connected to a Russian disinformation effort. Other US media say they have been unable to verify the authenticity of the emails. Hunter has neither confirmed nor denied that he dropped off a laptop at the location. Hunter joined Burisma in 2014, and remained on the board until April 2019, when he decided to leave. Speaking to the BBC, he said Burisma had seen his name "as gold" and that it had played a large part in his appointment to the board. Twitter and Facebook's action over Joe Biden article reignites bias claims What are the Bidens accused of in Ukraine? Donald Trump and his allies accused Joe Biden of wrongdoing because he had pushed, while vice-president, for the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, who was investigating the company for which Hunter worked. In 2016, Joe Biden called for the dismissal of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin, whose office had Burisma and other companies under investigation. However, other Western leaders and major bodies that give financial support to Ukraine also wanted the prosecutor dismissed because they believed he was not active enough in tackling corruption. What else has the Biden campaign said? Shortly before the final presidential debate last year, the Democrat's camp released a statement denying wrongdoing. "Joe Biden has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever," said the statement. "He has never held stock in any such business arrangements nor has any family member or any other person ever held stock for him. "What is true is that Tony Bobulinski admitted on the record to Breitbart that he is angry that he was *not* able to go into business with Hunter and James Biden [Joe Biden's brother]." What did this have to do with impeachment? In 2019, details emerged of a phone call Mr Trump, the then president, had made to the president of Ukraine, in which he had urged the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens. President Trump's impeachment explained This led to charges by the Democrats that Mr Trump was trying to illegally pressure Ukraine to help damage his election rival, resulting in impeachment by the House of Representatives. Mr Trump denied he had done anything wrong, and he was later acquitted by the Republican-controlled US Senate. Getty Images President Trump holds a copy of The Washington Post the day after the US Senate acquitted him on two articles of impeachment Has anything been proven against the Bidens? While no criminal activity has been proven, it has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest. A senior State Department official raised such concerns as far back as 2015. Joe Biden's son defends foreign dealings US Republican lawmakers launched an investigation and found last year that Hunter's work for the Ukrainian firm had been "problematic" - but there wasn't evidence that US foreign policy was influenced by it. No criminal charges were proven against Burisma either. The company issued a statement in 2017 saying "all legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations" against it were closed. Last year, Yuriy Lutsenko, the prosecutor in Ukraine who succeeded Viktor Shokin, told the BBC that there was no reason to investigate the Bidens under Ukrainian law. There is nothing illegal about sitting on a board of a company whilst family members serve in government. Hunter Biden's lawyers said in statement in October 2019 that he had undertaken "these business activities independently. He did not believe it appropriate to discuss them with his father, nor did he." Hunter told the New Yorker magazine that on the only occasion he had mentioned Burisma: "Dad said, 'I hope you know what you are doing.'" Amid all the scrutiny, Joe Biden promised last year that if he was elected president, no-one in his family would hold a job or have a business relationship with a foreign corporation or foreign government.

During the 2020 election campaign, he and his father were frequently accused by Donald Trump and his associates of wrongdoing in regards to China and Ukraine, allegations which they both denied. The New York Post reported on an alleged email in which an adviser from a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, apparently thanked Hunter for inviting him to meet his father, Joe Biden. Asked about the allegations, Joe Biden told a reporter it was a "smear campaign". No criminal activity has been proven, and no evidence has emerged that Mr Biden did anything to intentionally benefit his son. In an interview with the BBC months after his father was sworn in as president, Hunter Biden defended his qualifications for the position at Burisma but added that, in retrospect, he had "missed... the perception that I would create". Claims of influence-peddling are common in Washington DC and Mr Trump's children have also been accused of conflicts of interest in lucrative business deals overseas. They, too, deny wrongdoing. What do we know about the federal investigation? The Justice Department is investigating Hunter Biden's finances including scrutinising some of his past Chinese business dealings and other transactions, a "person familiar with the matter" told The Associated Press in December . The tax investigation was launched in 2018 but Hunter Biden said he had learned about it for the first time in December 2020. Asked about the investigation by US broadcaster CBS this April, the president's son said: "I'm co-operating, completely. And I'm absolutely certain, 100% certain, that at the end of the investigation, that I will be cleared of any wrongdoing." What have the Bidens been accused of in China? The New York Post cited a purported email from Hunter Biden in August 2017 indicating he was receiving a $10m annual fee from a Chinese billionaire for "introductions alone", though it is unclear who was involved in the alleged introductions. Another purported email, which Fox News said it had confirmed, reportedly refers to a deal pursued by Hunter involving China's largest private energy firm. It is said to include a cryptic mention of "10 held by H for the big guy". Fox News cited unnamed sources as saying "the big guy" in the purported email was a reference to Joe Biden. This message is said to be from May 2017. Both emails would date from when the former US vice-president was a private citizen. A former business associate of Hunter Biden has come forward to say he can confirm the allegations.

While framed by the president as addressing Hunter’s gun and tax charges, the pardon stunningly covers all crimes Hunter “committed or may have committed” from 2014 to 2023, a period covering Hunter’s questionable business dealings in Ukraine, China, and other foreign nations. In 2014, Hunter began receiving $1 million annually from Burisma, a company controlled by a Ukrainian oligarch which dealt in energy holdings, an industry with which Hunter had no relevant experience. Also, in February 2014, then-Vice-President Joe Biden dined with Russian and Kazakhstani oligarchs who were shortly thereafter responsible for millions of dollars in suspect money transfers including $142,300 which appears to have covered the cost of a car for Hunter. Rather than supporting the integrity of the legal system, by issuing this pardon, President Biden did the opposite and instead decided to put family above fairness to American taxpayers and law-abiding citizens. This is an unacceptable abuse of presidential powers. It has been said, “eternal vigilance is the price of liberty," and after the historic inflation, regulatory overreach, and failures of leadership we’ve seen throughout the Biden-Harris administration, it is clear reining in the excesses of the federal government has never been more urgent. As Republicans look forward to advancing sound policy for the American people in the coming year, we are preparing to deliver government accountability to the taxpayers, families, and small businesses which make up the backbone of our economy. This week, the office of Sen. Joni Ernst released a report showing only 6 percent of the more than two million federal employees work completely in-person rather than telework or remote work. Meanwhile, leasing, maintenance, and operations for federal office buildings costs taxpayers approximately $15.7 billion annually. This is the reason I supported the SHOW UP Act in 2023 to require federal agency employees to show up for work and get back to the business of serving the American people. Unfortunately, the bill has been ignored by Democrats in the Senate and White House. I am eager to ensure the government works more efficiently for the American people and welcome the opportunity to work toward this goal with Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and President Trump’s newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) which aims to address wasteful federal spending and bureaucratic bloat in the coming year. The IRS will be a good place for DOGE’s work to start. Overhauling the IRS requires new leadership. I applaud President Trump’s announcement of his plan to remove the current Commissioner Danny Werfel and nominate my former colleague, Billy Long to fill the role. Despite his commitments to “world-class customer service” and “to roll up [his] sleeves to help working families” during his confirmation process, Commissioner Werfel’s tenure at the IRS has instead focused on advancing the Biden-Harris agenda to intrude further into the financial privacy of American families and small businesses. We need an IRS commissioner who will restore accountability to the agency and its employees, ensure unelected bureaucrats do not harass Americans on the basis of ideology as it did under the Obama administration, simplify tax compliance, protect taxpayer data and privacy, update antiquated technology systems, return to wholly appropriated funding, end the unlawful Direct File Program, and have a true focus on serving taxpayers well. I hope Rep. Long will demonstrate his capacity to do this as the Senate considers his nomination. To combat inflation caused by overspending, clean up the morass of overregulation, and hold those entrusted with power accountable, we need to refocus and repair how the federal government serves Americans. In many ways this looks like getting Washington out of the way and allowing the American people do what they do best. President Ronald Reagan famously said, “the nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government, and I'm here to help.” It’s about time we restore accountability and focus on efficiency governmentwide. ### Issues : Economy Taxes Office Locations Washington DC Office 502 Cannon HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-6435 Fax: (202) 225-0207 Nebraska City District Office 202 South 8th Street Suite A Nebraska City, NE 68410 Phone: (402) 874-6050 Fax: (402) 874-6049 Grand Island District Office 1811 West Second Street Suite 275 Grand Island, NE 68803 Phone: (308) 384-3900 Fax: (308) 384-3902 Scottsbluff District Office 416 Valley View Dr. Suite 600 Scottsbluff, NE 69361 Phone: (308) 633-6333 Fax: (308) 633-6335 Copyright Privacy House.gov Accessibility RSSICYMI: Whistleblower Docs Show Burisma Hired Hunter Biden for His “Political Weight” and Carefully Navigated His Appointment to Protect Joe Biden – Ways and Means Skip to content About The Chairman The Committee Membership Subcommittees Internships News 2025 Tax Teams Activity Hearings Markups Calendar Listening To Americans Twitter Instagram Youtube ICYMI: Whistleblower Docs Show Burisma Hired Hunter Biden for His “Political Weight” and Carefully Navigated His Appointment to Protect Joe Biden November 17, 2023 A series of spreadsheets and emails included within the over 700 pages of whistleblower documents released by Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (MO-08) last month show an alarming pattern of meetings between senior White House staff, Hunter Biden business associate Devon Archer, and Hunter Biden in the same year then-Vice President Biden made an unprecedented three official visits to Ukraine. At the same time those meetings occurred, Archer was negotiating Hunter Biden’s position on the board of directors of Burisma – a Ukrainian company – whose executives implied his value to their company was his influence with his father. They even acknowledged the sensitive optics surrounding his appointment to the company’s board, and discussed the need to make his appointment public only after then-Vice President Biden’s first official trip to Ukraine concluded. April 15, 2014: Devon Archer meets with Vice President Biden at the White House. April 16, 2014: Hunter Biden has coffee with Greg Schultz, Senior Advisor to Vice President Biden. Later that same day, Hunter Biden meets with Devon Archer at the White House. April 17, 2014: A Burisma executive emails Devon Archer stating, as it relates to Hunter Biden, “ I do believe we have to reach a reasonable balance here ” and acknowledged they were relying on Hunter Biden’s influence with his father and would take into account how to use “ the political weight of our Directors… carefully and strategically. ” The email went on to say they would list Hunter Biden on their website “ after his father left our country” and underlined how Burisma could not, “hide our directors. ” April 21, 2014: Then-Vice President Joe Biden travels to Ukraine. May 12, 2014 : Hunter Biden appointed to Burisma’s board of directors. May 13, 2014: According to emails obtained from the Hunter Biden laptop, Eric Schwerin, another Hunter Biden business associate, directed a photo of Joe Biden and Devon Archer that was taken at the April 15th White House meeting be removed from Burisma’s website at the request of the Vice President’s General Counsel. June 7, 2014: Then-Vice President Joe Biden travels to Ukraine for a second time to attend the inauguration of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. September 24, 2014: Devon Archer forwards an email to Hunter Biden discussing the need to “alert U.S. officials who might be able to influence Ukraine to not adopt such harmful measures.” October 27, 2014: Hunter Biden receives an email from a U.S. government official stating, “Secretary of State may be calling you soon.” November 20, 2014: Then-Vice President Biden visits Ukraine for a third time. December 17, 2014: Eric Schwerin emails Hunter Biden to request then-Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s email address. Chairman Smith said, “It is hard to believe the timing of Hunter Biden’s appointment to the board of Burisma and his father’s multiple official visits to Ukraine are mere coincidence. House Republicans are determined to get to the bottom of the Biden family’s influence peddling scheme, and the American people have a right to know if then-Vice President Biden used his official government position to help his family’s overseas business operations. “Thanks to the IRS whistleblowers we know President Biden lied when he said he had no knowledge and was not involved in his son’s business dealings. It now appears he in fact benefited. We will continue to follow the facts in this investigation and present the truth to the American people.” READ : Bombshell: Ways and Means Releases New Documents Revealing Hunter Biden Selling Access to White House, Investigators Blocked from Pursuing Evidence Related to President Biden READ : ICYMI: Documents Confirm Joe Biden was his Family’s “Only Asset” and “The Brand” READ : ICYMI: New Documents Link Biden Family Influence Peddling Scheme to 23 Countries, Four Continents READ : ICYMI: Hunter Biden’s Business Associates Enjoyed White House Dinners, Flights on Air Force 2 Internships Minority Subscribe Archive Privacy Policy News Twitter Instagram Youtube 1139 Longworth HOB Washington D.C. 20515 | P: (202) 225-3625ICYMI: President Trump’s Largest Tax Cut in History – The White House Menu President Donald J.

Verdict One correct, two incorrect Source Kenya’s former prime minister Raila Odinga (August 2020) This article is more than 4 years old Since 2004 Nigeria’s revenue sharing formula has given 52.68% to the federal government, 26.72% to states and 20.60% to local governments. Odinga was correct about local governments’ share, but wide of the mark for the other two government levels. And experts question his claim that Nigeria’s system “works perfectly well”. After months of an often fractious stalemate , in September 2020 Kenya’s senate hammered out a deal on how revenue would be shared between the country’s two levels of government. In August, at the height of the deadlock, former prime minister Odinga returned to a familiar talking point to argue for establishing a third tier of government. Building on this in an interview with Citizen TV , Odinga, who is also an African Union envoy , said Kenya could solve the recurring battle over how to share revenue if it looked to Nigeria for lessons. Nigeria, he said, had a local, state and federal system of government. “In terms of revenue share, 20% of the revenue goes to the local, 35% goes to the state and 45% goes to the federal governments ... and it works perfectly well,” Odinga said . We checked if he was on the mark about how revenue is shared in Africa’s largest economy . Claim In Nigeria … in terms of revenue share, 20% goes to the local government. Verdict correct We asked Dennis Onyango, Odinga’s spokesperson, for the source of the former leader’s claims. We will update this report with his response. In line with its constitution , Nigeria has a federal capital authority, 36 states and 768 local government authorities. There are also six area councils. The Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission proposes a formula for how revenue is to be shared between the three levels. This is then approved by the national assembly . The revenue formula was first used in 1982 when the Nigeria Revenue Allocation Act came into effect. The law stipulated that 56% of funds would go to the federal government, 24% to states and 20% to local governments. The current formula can be traced to a March 2004 circular from the finance ministry. It has remained at these levels since. “The revenue allocation formula is still 52.68%, 26.72% and 20.6%,” Prof Sherifdeen Tella, professor of economics at Olabisi Onabanjo University told Africa Check. Before the revenue is split an amount “not less than 13%” is deducted and shared among the oil producing states based on their production levels. According to data from Nigeria's extractive industries transparency initiative , a government agency supervised by the president’s office, local governments get 20.6% of national revenue. We therefore rate Odinga as correct on this claim. Recent local government allocations at 20% The most recent full year data from the budget office shows that in 2019, local governments received N1.04 trillion of the N5.05 trillion available for sharing among the three levels of government. And in the first quarter of 2020, local governments got N441.44 billion of the N2.14 trillion available. Both these amounts work out to about 20% for local governments. (Note: Value-added tax is also shared among the three levels of government, using a different formula. Local governments get 35% of VAT revenue, state governments 50% and the federal government 15%.) Claim 35% of revenue goes to states. Verdict incorrect Data from Nigeria's extractive industries transparency initiative shows that 26.72% is reserved for the state governments, not the 35% Odinga claimed. We therefore rate this claim as incorrect. In 2019, of the N5.05 trillion available for sharing, states got N1.35 trillion. In the first quarter of 2020, states received N572.59 billion of the N2.14 trillion available. Both these allocations work out to 26.72%, in keeping with the formula. Claim 45% of revenue goes to the federal governments. Verdict incorrect Odinga’s claim of 45% is not accurate. Official data shows the federal government gets more than half of the total revenue. In 2019, data from the budget office shows the federal government received N2.66 trillion of the N5.05 trillion available for sharing. In the first quarter of 2020 it got N1.13 trillion out of N2.14 trillion. These amounts tally with the 52.68% set out in the sharing formula. Does Nigeria’s revenue sharing model work ‘perfectly well’? Raila Odinga’s assertion that the Nigerian revenue sharing formula “works perfectly” is contested. Gazie Okpara , a professor of marketing at Abia State University in southeast Nigeria whose interests include social policy, said the formula was imperfect because how the funds were spent was not transparent. “Each level of government should always give an account of how funds were spent,” he said, an audit that should be provided for in the constitution. Prof Sherifdeen Tella, a professor of economics at Olabisi Onabanjo University in southwestern Nigeria, told Africa Check that in his view, allocations to state and local governments, and especially the former, should be increased. “What is allocated to these two tiers of government is not sufficient.” Matthew Akintayo is a professor at the University of Ibadan , also in southwestern Nigeria. One of his focus areas is the economics of education. He told Africa Check that the sharing formula should be restructured. “A bulk or vast fraction of resources should be allocated to the state and local government because both arms of government are closer to the grassroots,” he said. He added that state governors should be given more leeway to manage their resources. John Kinuthia, a senior programme officer at the International Budget Partnership , told Africa Check that Odinga should also have considered the nature of devolved functions when drawing comparisons. It was difficult to compare Kenyan counties with Nigerian states, partly because they had different functions, Kinuthia said. He gave the example of education. “In Nigeria there are functions like education that are devolved, which is why you see a bigger proportion of resources at the subnational level compared to Kenya. In Kenya, education is still at the national level.” Republish our content for free We believe that everyone needs the facts.

That is the estimated number of illegal aliens who will receive amnesty under President Biden’s latest executive action, which will make many of the migrants eligible for green cards, work permits, and a pathway to U.S. citizenship. According to President Biden, this decision is “commonsense.” But to millions of Tennesseans and Americans, it is just the latest example of how the President is working to undermine the rule of law, devalue U.S. citizenship, and make illegal immigration legal. In just his first 100 days in office, President Biden issued 94 executive orders to open our border, including halting construction of the southern border wall, ending the successful Trump-era Remain in Mexico policy, and pausing deportations. Since then, more than 10 million illegal aliens have entered our country—larger than the population of 38 states. Despite the many harms of their open border agenda, President Biden and Democrats have championed it for a simple reason : to gain more seats in Congress. Thanks to a day-one executive order by President Biden, illegal aliens count toward the census population, which determines each state’s share of congressional seats. By taking in as many illegal aliens as possible, Democrat states can help offset the loss of hundreds of thousands of Americans who are fleeing blue jurisdictions for red states. By granting amnesty to hundreds of thousands of illegals, the Biden administration is building on this effort, setting the stage for illegal immigrants to potentially vote in future U.S. elections. Last week, I wrote a letter to President Biden pointing out that his amnesty proposal is blatantly unconstitutional by side-stepping congressional authority to alter the legal status of hundreds of thousands of illegals. To be sure, I expect federal courts will deem President Biden’s action unlawful, much like President Obama’s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals memorandum, which also extended deportation protections to illegal immigrants. Still, while President Biden pushes ahead with his unconstitutional amnesty plan and open border agenda, the American people will be left to deal with the consequences—including a record surge in migrant crime. Since October alone, U.S. authorities have apprehended 13,130 illegal aliens with prior criminal convictions—including homicide, burglary, assault, drug trafficking, and sexual offenses—up from 2,438 in fiscal year 2020, the last full year of the Trump administration. In 2023, that number was 15,267—a more than five-fold increase from 2020. Just last week, an illegal alien from Ecuador, who crossed the southern border in 2021, was arrested for raping a 13-year-old girl while wielding a machete in a park in Queens, New York. Also last week, Houston police arrested two Venezuelan illegal aliens for kidnapping and strangling a 12-year-old girl before leaving her body in a bayou. The suspects allegedly committed the heinous crime just weeks after the Biden administration released them into our country after they illegally crossed the southern border. And earlier this month, law enforcement arrested a Salvadoran illegal alien for raping and murdering a 37-year-old mother of five in Maryland. The suspect, who is also accused of murdering a woman in El Salvador and assaulting a 9-year-old girl and her mother in Los Angeles, crossed the southern border four times last year. These horrific crimes would have never happened if President Biden secured our southern border. Instead, the President is more concerned about protecting illegal aliens than American citizens—with tragic consequences. https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2024/6/with-his-amnesty-order-president-biden-is-making-illegal-immigration-legal News Subscribe to the Blackburn Report Speeches Columns Office Locations Memphis Jackson Nashville Chattanooga Knoxville Tri-cities D.C.

After losing the case in federal court, the Biden Administration declined to appeal, forfeiting any further claims. The Biden Administration was directed by the court to continue border wall construction using the funding that Congress appropriated for the purpose. At the urging of President Donald Trump, Congress dedicated roughly $1.4 billion to the construction of walls and barriers along the southern border in order to reduce the number of aliens entering the country in 2019 and 2020. Immediately upon taking office, President Joseph Biden issued an unlawful executive order stopping border wall construction and directing the Department of Homeland Security to devise a way to redirect the funds. Texas sued under the Administrative Procedure Act to stop this scheme, arguing that Biden violated the Consolidated Appropriations Act and asking the court to require the Biden Administration to follow the law and use the appropriated money for the purpose Congress directed. Earlier this year, a federal district court granted a permanent injunction to end the Administration’s effort to illegally defund the border wall. The Biden Administration allowed the sixty-day appeal window to expire on July 29, 2024, and the permanent injunction remains in place. “This is a final victory against Biden’s attempt to defund the border wall. His Administration illegally sought to prevent the construction of the border wall and illegally attempted to repurpose the money allocated for American safety and sovereignty, working instead to keep the border open,” said Attorney General Paxton. “I sued and won to stop their unlawful scheme. Now, the Administration has thrown in the towel by declining to appeal their defeat and will be legally required to build the wall.” To read the final order, click here.

Thanks to a day-one executive order by President Biden, illegal aliens count toward the census population, which determines each state’s share of congressional seats. By taking in as many illegal aliens as possible, Democrat states can help offset the loss of hundreds of thousands of Americans who are fleeing blue jurisdictions for red states. By granting amnesty to hundreds of thousands of illegals, the Biden administration is building on this effort, setting the stage for illegal immigrants to potentially vote in future U.S. elections. Last week, I wrote a letter to President Biden pointing out that his amnesty proposal is blatantly unconstitutional by side-stepping congressional authority to alter the legal status of hundreds of thousands of illegals. To be sure, I expect federal courts will deem President Biden’s action unlawful, much like President Obama’s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals memorandum, which also extended deportation protections to illegal immigrants. Still, while President Biden pushes ahead with his unconstitutional amnesty plan and open border agenda, the American people will be left to deal with the consequences—including a record surge in migrant crime. Since October alone, U.S. authorities have apprehended 13,130 illegal aliens with prior criminal convictions—including homicide, burglary, assault, drug trafficking, and sexual offenses—up from 2,438 in fiscal year 2020, the last full year of the Trump administration. In 2023, that number was 15,267—a more than five-fold increase from 2020. Just last week, an illegal alien from Ecuador, who crossed the southern border in 2021, was arrested for raping a 13-year-old girl while wielding a machete in a park in Queens, New York. Also last week, Houston police arrested two Venezuelan illegal aliens for kidnapping and strangling a 12-year-old girl before leaving her body in a bayou. The suspects allegedly committed the heinous crime just weeks after the Biden administration released them into our country after they illegally crossed the southern border. And earlier this month, law enforcement arrested a Salvadoran illegal alien for raping and murdering a 37-year-old mother of five in Maryland. The suspect, who is also accused of murdering a woman in El Salvador and assaulting a 9-year-old girl and her mother in Los Angeles, crossed the southern border four times last year. These horrific crimes would have never happened if President Biden secured our southern border. Instead, the President is more concerned about protecting illegal aliens than American citizens—with tragic consequences. https://www.blackburn.senate.gov/2024/6/with-his-amnesty-order-president-biden-is-making-illegal-immigration-legal News Subscribe to the Blackburn Report Speeches Columns Office Locations Memphis Jackson Nashville Chattanooga Knoxville Tri-cities D.C.

Erik Mcgregor/LightRocket via Getty Images, FILE The Biden administration has finalized plans to expand government-subsidized health insurance for people brought to the country illegally as children but shielded from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Immigrants with DACA status receive protections from deportation but had been formerly barred from receiving health care coverage made available by the Affordable Care Act. But now, an estimated 100,000 previously uninsured DACA holders can enroll in coverage, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, fulfilling a pledge the White House made last year. MORE: Judge again finds DACA illegal but doesn't strike down existing protections "Dreamers are our neighbors and friends; They are students, teachers, social workers, doctors, and nurses. More importantly, they are fellow Americans," Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement on Thursday, referring to the frequent nickname for DACA holders. "More than one third of DACA recipients currently do not have health insurance, so making them eligible to enroll in coverage will improve their health and wellbeing, and help the overall economy," Becerra said.

Household income and the option to obtain health coverage from an employer will be factors in coverage eligibility, an administration official said. Participant holds a protest sign at a rally as immigration advocates and allies gathered at Battery Park, New York City, on Oct. 26, 2019. Erik Mcgregor/LightRocket via Getty Images, FILE "This final rule also reflects the president's belief that health care is a right not a privilege for all Americans, that it should extend to DACA recipients just like the rest of us," White House Domestic Policy Advisor Neera Tanden told reporters. "This landmark final rule will make DACA recipients eligible for the Affordable Care Act coverage for the first time." The Obama-era DACA program, which dates back to 2012, is controversial among conservatives and has long been tied up in legal battles. The Biden administration is seeking to protect it from further legal scrutiny by codifying it into regulatory policy -- an ongoing process. The Biden administration has also faced criticism from some advocates and Democrats for abandoning a potential pathway to citizenship for DACA holders as part of bipartisan Senate negotiations on immigration earlier this year. Democrats continue to blame Republicans for rejecting that deal despite the long-time objections of many in the GOP to a citizenship pathway for migrants already living in the country after entering illegally.

More Info I would like to contribute One Time Monthly Yearly Join Now Howard Marklein stated on August 25, 2020 in News release: Says Gov. Tony Evers and Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, after police shooting of Jacob Blake, "did not call for peace. They did not encourage calm. National Legal Issues Guns Wisconsin Howard Marklein By D.L. Davis August 28, 2020 Claim that Evers, Barnes did not call for peace, calm after Blake shooting goes too far If Your Time is short In an August 23, 2020 Evers news release there was no call for calm or peace. In a 10-minute August 24, 2020 video address, Evers and Barnes did not directly reference violence and damage in Kenosha the night before. But during that August 24, 2020 video, Evers did say "every person should be able to make their voices heard" and "If you are exercising that right today and in the days ahead, please do so peacefully." Evers did not more forcefully criticize the Kenosha violence until after Marklein’s statement. See the sources for this fact-check The national protests over police brutality that started in Minnesota after a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd by kneeling for nearly nine minutes on his neck have now focused squarely on Wisconsin. On Sunday August 23, 2020, a Kenosha police officer shot Jacob Blake in the back multiple times at close range as Blake tried to get into a small SUV. Protests re-ignited across the country, including in Madison and, of course, Kenosha, where buildings were vandalized and burned, windows smashed out and stores looted. State Sen. Howard Marklein, R-Spring Green, decried the destruction in an August 25, 2020, news release and Facebook post. "There is absolutely no justification for the vandalism, destruction, rioting and looting that took place at the State Capitol, in the City of Madison or the City of Kenosha last night," Marklein posted on Facebook . Then he took aim at the state’s Democratic leaders. Sign up for PolitiFact texts "We need leadership in this state to take a stand, protect our citizens and call for peace, rather than capitulating to violent mobs. Governor Tony Evers and Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes made irresponsible comments about the incident in Kenosha before having all of the facts. They did not call for peace. They did not encourage calm." The statement came before a night of chaos involving protesters and armed militia members left two men dead and a third man injured. Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, of Antioch, Ill., is charged with shooting the men. Rittenhouse is a self-described militia member. We’ll focus on the last part of Marklein’s claim. Did Evers and Barnes "not call for peace" and "not encourage calm" in the wake of the Blake shooting? The evidence When asked to provide backup for the statement, Katy Prange, Marklein’s chief of staff, focused on the timing and context of statements made by Evers and Barnes. Let’s look at the sequence. Here is the complete August 23, 2020 news release from the governor’s office, hours after the incident: MADISON — Gov. Evers tonight released the following statement regarding the officer-involved shooting that critically injured a Black man in Kenosha. "Tonight, Jacob Blake was shot in the back multiple times, in broad daylight, in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Kathy and I join his family, friends, and neighbors in hoping earnestly that he will not succumb to his injuries. While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first Black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country. We stand with all those who have and continue to demand justice, equity, and accountability for Black lives in our country—lives like those of George Floyd, of Breonna Taylor, Tony Robinson, Dontre Hamilton, Ernest Lacy, and Sylville Smith. And we stand against excessive use of force and immediate escalation when engaging with Black Wisconsinites. I have said all along that although we must offer our empathy, equally important is our action. In the coming days, we will demand just that of elected officials in our state who have failed to recognize the racism in our state and our country for far too long." There was no call for peace or calm in the statement. The following morning, Evers’s office issued a video message : In the video address, neither Evers nor Barnes mentioned the violence or damage from the previous night, but they did ask that those protesting "do so peacefully." Featured Fact-check Pete Hegseth stated on March 24, 2025 in an interview "Nobody was texting war plans" in the Trump administration Signal group text about bombing Yemen. By Grace Abels • March 26, 2025 Marklein’s statement was posted on Facebook at 11:06 a.m. the next day, August 25. So, that’s our starting point for the accuracy of the claim. We also looked at Barnes’ tweets and Facebook posts, but did not find any reference to calling for peace or calm prior to Marklein’s post. In a news release later that day, Evers said: "Tonight, and in the days ahead, if you are going to protest, please do so peacefully and safely. Please do not allow the actions of a few distract us from the work we must do together to demand justice, equity, and accountability." So, clearly, that statement from Evers -- his strongest on the question of peace and calm -- came after Marklein’s claim. Britt Cudaback, Evers’ deputy communications director, argued Evers had called for a peaceful protest the day before Marklein’s claim, citing the video message Barnes’ communications director Chet Agni, said Marklein was making "broad claims." "Our administration has been calling for people to exercise their First Amendment rights peacefully and safely since before Sen. Marklein released his statement, just as our administration did during the unrest following the murder of George Floyd months ago," he said in an email. That said, our research, and the information provided by the offices of Evers and Barnes, shows a single reference to "peacefully" before the Marklein statement was made. Our ruling Marklein claimed that Evers and Barnes, after the police shooting of Jacob Blake, "did not call for peace. They did not encourage calm." The governor did not call for peace and calm in his statement hours after the incident. But in a video statement posted the next day, Evers urged people planning to protest to "do so peacefully." That said, his most direct comments -- saying the Kenosha protests went too far -- didn’t come until after Marklein’s statement. We rate Marklein’s claim Mostly False.

The Bills proposed that the revenue distributable to States remains at 35%. The propsoed legislative reforms also proposed zero VAT on exports and essential consumptions by the masses and grant of input VAT credit on assets and services in addition to goods consumed by businesses to lower the cost of production. President Bola Tinubu introduced the Tax Reform Bills, comprising the Joint Revenue Board of Nigeria (Establishment) Bill, 2024; Nigeria Revenue Service (Establishment) Bill, 2024; Nigeria Revenue Service (Establishment) Bill, 2024 and Nigeria Tax Bill, 2024. The bills elicited spirited interests among key lawmakers and stakeholders across party lines, a situation that informed the leadership of the Senate to invite both Taiwo Oyedele and Zacch Adedeji, Chairman, the Presidential Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms Committee and Chairman, the Federal Inland Revenue Service, respectively, to brief its plenary. Leading debate at the plenary on Thursday, Bamidele Opeyemi, the Senate leader explained that the Bills were aimed at simplifying the tax landscape, reducing the burden on small business and streamlining how taxes are collected. In the area of tax exemptions, Bamidele pointed out that those, whose salaries are not more than the minimum wage from Pay As You Earn (PAYE) deductions, would be exempted from the tax regime. He also said small businesses with annual turnover of N50 million or less “are equally exempted from payment of taxes,” a key pro-business initiative that encourages job creation; deepens ease of doing business and incentivises more investments. Similarly, the senate leader explained that there was a proposed huge reduction in company income tax from the current 30% to 25% that would last for at least two years.

Contrary to publuc opinion regarding the intendment of the Bills under consideration, Bamidele explained that the bills contained innovative and people-oriented proposals as part of the government’s deliberate fiscal and tax reform measures to cushion the effect of ongoing broader economic policies such as the removal of subsidy on petroleum products, renewed efforts to implement cost -reflective electricity tariffs in the power sector etc on Nigerian citizens.

Speaking to an MLK Day breakfast at Upper Room Church of God in Christ in Raleigh, Forest said this: “There is no doubt that when Planned Parenthood was created, it was created to destroy the entire black race. That was the purpose of Planned Parenthood. That’s the truth.” Forest later defended his comments to McClatchy News: “The facts speak for themselves. Since 1973, 19 million black babies have been aborted, mostly by Planned Parenthood. I care too much about the lives of these babies to debate the intent of Sanger’s views when the devastation she brought into this world is obvious.” Margaret Sanger, her sister, Ethel Byrne, and Fania Mindell opened the first birth control clinic in the United States in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, New York on October 16, 1916. The clinic was later raided by the NYPD, and all three women were arrested and charged with violating the Comstock Act for distributing obscene materials. After laws governing birth control were relaxed, Sanger founded the American Birth Control League in 1921, which was renamed the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in 1942. While Lieutenant Governor Forest was attacked by many on the Left for pushing an uneducated, insensitive agenda, history backs him up. The fact is that Margaret Sanger strongly believed the Aryan race to be superior and that it must be purified, a view that finds its roots from Charles Darwin’s defense of evolution in The Origin of Species . Darwin argued that a process of “natural selection” favored the white race over all other “lesser races.” Sanger advocated for eugenics by calling for abortion and birth control among the “unfit” to produce a master race, a race consisting solely of wealthy, educated whites. Sanger said she believed blacks were “human weeds” that needed to be exterminated. She also referred to immigrants, African Americans, and poor people as “reckless breeders” and “spawning…human beings who never should have been born.” Sanger once wrote “that the aboriginal Australian, the lowest known species of the human family, just a step higher than the chimpanzee in brain development, has so little sexual control that police authority alone prevents him from obtaining sexual satisfaction on the streets.” In an effort to sell her birth control and abortion proposals to the black community, Sanger said : “We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population.” In 1926, Sanger was also the featured speaker at a women’s auxiliary meeting of the Ku Klux Klan in Silver Lake, New Jersey. Sanger opened her clinics in largely minority neighborhoods because she believed immigrants and the working class were inferior and needed their population controlled so as to purify the human race. That trend continues today where almost 80 percent of Planned Parenthood facilities are located in minority neighborhoods. In fact, although only 13 percent of American women are black, over 35 percent of all black babies are aborted in the United States every year. Abortion is the leading cause of death for blacks in the United States. According to Students for Life of America , “more African-Americans have died from abortion than from AIDS, accidents, violent crimes, cancer, and heart disease combined.” Black babies are about five times more likely to be aborted than whites. On Halloween in 2017, Planned Parenthood’s “Black Community” Twitter account tweeted : “If you’re a Black woman in America, it’s statistically safer to have an abortion than to carry a pregnancy to term or give birth.” While Margaret Sanger tried to portray Planned Parenthood as a merciful organization that helps needy families, the facts speak for themselves. In her testimony to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in September 2015, former Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards openly admitted that over 80 percent of her organization’s annual revenue comes from performing abortions and not basic health care for poor or disadvantaged women. When you dive deeper , well over 90 percent of Planned Parenthood’s annual revenue comes from performing abortions. Despite this sordid history, Margaret Sanger is almost universally recognized as a pioneer for women’s rights rather than the racist she actually was. When accepting Planned Parenthood’s Margaret Sanger Award, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that she “admired Margaret Sanger enormously, her courage, her tenacity, her vision…I am really in awe of her.” Those like Hillary Clinton are ignoring the explicitly racist statements that Margaret Sanger made throughout her life. The fact is that Sanger normalized birth control and abortion in the United States as a means to accomplish eugenics. Her ultimate goal was to eliminate non-white races, people with sickness or disabilities, children born to felons, the poor, and immigrants, to name a few. Margaret Sanger is no heroine, and Planned Parenthood is not some merciful health care provider as the Left paints it to be. Margaret Sanger repeatedly stated her racist intentions for the whole world to see and hear, and Planned Parenthood was and still is the manifestation of those racist ideologies. America was founded on the idea that no matter your race, creed, national origin, disability, or station in life, everyone who comes here or is born here has the opportunity to live a successful, fulfilling life. Margaret Sanger didn’t believe that. As pro-life activists, we must do our part to expose Margaret Sanger for who she really was. We must also expose the racist history of Planned Parenthood and how that history is still relevant today.

What did Margaret Sanger do for a living? Margaret Sanger practiced obstetrical nursing on the Lower East Side of New York City, where she witnessed the relationships between poverty , uncontrolled fertility , high rates of infant and maternal mortality, and deaths from botched illegal abortions . Those observations made Sanger a feminist who believed in every woman’s right to avoid unwanted pregnancies . What did Margaret Sanger accomplish? In 1916 Margaret Sanger opened the first birth control clinic in the U.S., in Brooklyn . She was arrested and charged with maintaining a “public nuisance,” and in 1917 she served 30 days in the Queens penitentiary. Sanger’s legal appeals prompted the federal courts to reinterpret the Comstock Act , permitting physicians to import and prescribe contraceptives . Margaret Sanger (more) Margaret Sanger (born September 14, 1879, Corning , New York , U.S.—died September 6, 1966, Tucson , Arizona) was the founder of the birth control movement in the United States and an international leader in the field. She is credited with originating the term birth control . Margaret Sanger Margaret Sanger, 1922. (more) Sanger was the sixth of 11 children. She attended Claverack College and then took nurse’s training in New York at the White Plains Hospital and the Manhattan Eye and Ear Clinic. She was married twice, to William Sanger in 1900 and, after a divorce, to J. Noah H. Slee in 1922. After a brief teaching career, she practiced obstetrical nursing on the Lower East Side of New York City, where she witnessed the relationships between poverty , uncontrolled fertility , high rates of infant and maternal mortality, and deaths from botched illegal abortions . These observations made Sanger a feminist who believed in every woman’s right to avoid unwanted pregnancies , and she devoted herself to removing the legal barriers to publicizing the facts about contraception . 1 of 2 What Every Girl Should Know (1922/23) Front and back covers of Margaret Sanger's pamphlet What Every Girl Should Know (1922/23), a compilation of Sanger's writings from 1912–13 on sex education and birth control. (more) 2 of 2 Margaret Sanger Margaret Sanger with a client in a family-planning and birth-control clinic. (more) In 1912 Sanger gave up nursing to devote herself to the cause of birth control and sex education, publishing a series of articles on the topics, including “ What Every Girl Should Know ” for the New York Call . In 1914 she issued a short-lived magazine, The Woman Rebel , and distributed a pamphlet, Family Limitation , advocating her views. She was indicted for mailing materials advocating birth control, but the charges were dropped in 1916. Later that year she opened in Brooklyn the first birth control clinic in the United States. She was arrested and charged with maintaining a “public nuisance,” and in 1917 she served 30 days in the Queens penitentiary. While she was serving time, the first issue of her periodical The Birth Control Review was published. Her sentencing and subsequent episodes of legal harassment helped to crystallize public opinion in favour of the birth control movement. Sanger’s legal appeals prompted the federal courts first to grant physicians the right to give advice about birth control methods and then, in 1936, to reinterpret the Comstock Act of 1873 (which had classified contraceptive literature and devices as obscene materials) in such a way as to permit physicians to import and prescribe contraceptives. Britannica Quiz American History and Politics Quiz Margaret Sanger (more) In 1921 Sanger founded the American Birth Control League , and she served as its president until 1928. The league was one of the parent organizations of the Birth Control Federation of America, which in 1942 became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America , with Sanger as honorary chairman. Sanger, who had traveled to Europe to study the issue of birth control there, also organized the first World Population Conference in Geneva in 1927, and she was the first president of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (founded 1953). Subsequently she took her campaign for birth control to Asian countries, especially India and Japan. Sanger’s legacy has been complicated by her support of eugenics , the idea that selective breeding for desired heritable characteristics could improve future generations of humans—an idea that was popular in the early 20th century (though it was later debunked). At the time Sanger began her work with birth control, eugenics was championed by well-known and respected scientists. It is unclear how extensively Sanger was involved in the eugenics movement, though she did believe that birth control could be used to prevent the breeding of unfit individuals. In addition, through the “Negro Project,” working closely with NAACP leader W.E.B. Du Bois , Sanger brought birth control to African American communities . As a consequence of these actions, critics have described Sanger as racist. However, as with her work in white communities, Sanger emphasized the importance of giving African Americans choices about parenthood and the number of children they wished to have. It is generally accepted that Sanger’s notions were no more racist than those found in society in general at the time. Among her numerous books are What Every Mother Should Know (1917), My Fight for Birth Control (1931), and Margaret Sanger: An Autobiography (1938).

Rand Paul, R-Ky., questions Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a Senate Foreign Relations committee hearing on the State Department's 2021 budget on Capitol Hill, July 30, 2020, in Washington. (Jim Lo Scalzo/Pool via AP) By Miriam Valverde August 26, 2020 Fact-checking Rand Paul on Joe Biden and support for wars If Your Time is short Biden as a senator voted for resolutions that supported interventions in Iraq and Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). As vice president, he followed the policies of the Obama administration, which included interventions in Syria and Libya. Biden’s campaign said that Biden as vice president supported going into Syria, but pointed to 2016 reporting that said Biden within the White House argued against intervention in Libya. See the sources for this fact-check Republican Sen. Rand Paul advocated for President Donald Trump’s re-election by portraying him as someone who wants to end wars and casting Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as someone "who consistently called for more war." "Joe Biden voted for the Iraq War, which President Trump has long called the worst geopolitical mistake of our generation," Paul said Aug. 25 during the second night of the Republican National Convention. "I fear Biden will choose war again. He supported the war in Serbia, Syria, Libya." Is the senator from Kentucky right about Biden’s record? Biden voted for a resolution that paved the way for the Iraq War, and for a non-binding resolution to authorize military air operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). The conflicts in Syria and Libya happened when Biden was vice president and followed the policies of President Barack Obama. Biden ‘voted for the Iraq War’ This checks out. In 2002, President George W. Bush argued that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein had chemical and biological weapons, sought nuclear weapons, supported terrorism, and threatened peace. In October 2002, then-U.S. Sen. Biden voted in favor of a resolution that authorized Bush to enforce ''all relevant'' United Nations Security Council resolutions on Iraq and if needed, to use military force against Iraq. Sign up for PolitiFact texts In a Senate floor speech before voting for the resolution, Biden said that "failure to overwhelmingly support" the resolution was "likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur." The objective of the resolution was to compel Iraq to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, Biden said. He left open the possibility that Hussein might "miscalculate" and "misjudge" U.S. resolve. In that event, use of military force might be needed, Biden said. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, and the war officially ended in late 2011. No weapons of mass destruction were found. In 2005, Biden was asked i n an interview if his 2002 vote was a mistake. "It was a mistake," Biden answered. "It was a mistake to assume the president would use the authority we gave him properly. … We gave the president the authority to unite the world to isolate Saddam. And the fact of the matter is, we went too soon. We went without sufficient force. And we went without a plan." RELATED : Trump still wrong on his claim that he opposed Iraq War ahead of the invasion Biden ‘supported war in Serbia, Syria, Libya’ Serbia : Biden voted for a 1999 concurrent resolution authorizing President Bill Clinton to conduct military air operations and missile strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), in cooperation with North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies. (Concurrent resolutions express the sentiment of Congress, but are not signed by the president and do not carry the force of law.) Clinton in March 1999 ordered air strikes in response to Yugoslavia’s campaign of violence against ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo. The Kosovo conflict erupted in the 1990s between two groups within the former Yugoslavia — Kosovars, who are primarily ethnic Albanians, and Serbs, who are of Slavic descent. The two groups long disputed the territory known as Kosovo. After greater Yugoslavia fractured in the early 1990s, the dispute over Kosovo became violent, pitting the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army against the Serb-dominated government of what remained of Yugoslavia. Paul’s office referenced conflicts in Syria and Libya that started in 2011, when Biden was vice president. Featured Fact-check Paul Krugman stated on November 29, 2009 in ABC's 'This Week with George Stephanopoulos' "If you want to talk firsts for Bush, this was the first time in American history that a president took us into a war and cut taxes." By Robert Farley • November 30, 2009 Syria : Syrians began protesting their government in early 2011 , calling for political and social reforms and the ouster of their president. The protests prompted a violent response from the Syrian government. The conflict escalated as different groups within the country, foreign countries, and terrorists became involved. The United States since 2011 has called for Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad to step aside. The Obama administration in 2014 launched air strikes against the Islamic State in Syria and in 2015 deployed troops there to fight the terrorist group. Biden’s campaign said the Obama-Biden administration supported the Syrian opposition in a variety of ways, including by deploying U.S. forces to combat ISIS. Libya : The United States, as part of a NATO operation, provided air support in an intervention that resulted in the ouster of the country’s longtime dictator, Moammar Gadhafi. Obama said Gadhafi was launching military actions that were causing civilian deaths and forcing ordinary Libyans to escape to neighboring countries, threatening a humanitarian crisis within Libya and instability for its neighbors, Egypt and Tunisia. The U.S. military spent about $2 billion and several months backing the Libyan uprising against Gadhafi. The uprising — part of the Arab Spring — toppled Gadhafi in August 2011, and rebel forces killed him that October. Paul’s office sent us as a 2011 fact-check of Biden as evidence for his support of the U.S. intervention. In that fact-check, we examined Biden’s claim that in Libya, "America spent $2 billion total and didn’t lose a single life." We rated that Mostly True. (The fact-check did not focus on Biden’s own position on the issue.) Biden’s campaign, however, pointed to a 2016 Politico report that referenced an interview Biden gave to journalist Charlie Rose in which he said that intervening in Libya was wrong. The Politico story said that Biden told Rose that he had "argued strongly" within the White House "against going ... to Libya." Politico reported that Biden in that interview also said the United States should not use force unless the interests of the country or its allies are directly threatened, whether it can be done "efficaciously" and whether it can be sustained. Our ruling Paul said Biden, "Voted for the Iraq war … He supported war in Serbia, Syria, Libya." Biden as a senator voted for resolutions that supported interventions in Iraq and Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). As vice president, he followed the policies of the Obama administration, which included interventions in Syria and Libya. Biden’s campaign said that Biden as vice president supported going into Syria, but pointed to 2016 reporting that said Biden within the White House argued against intervention in Libya. Paul’s claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True. Read About Our Process The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter Our Sources Email interview, Sen.

That’s not accurate, and Biden now says he misspoke. The public position taken in the lead-up to and early days of the Iraq war has been a litmus test for many presidential candidates. Sen. Bernie Sanders proudly boasts about his vote — while serving as a member of the House in late 2002 — against authorizing use of military force against Iraq. While running for president, Donald Trump repeatedly claimed that he publicly opposed the Iraq war before the March 19, 2003, invasion, though we looked into it and could find no evidence that he ever did. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when the authorization vote was cast, Biden was at the forefront of the debate about what course to pursue with Iraq. As a result, he was also frequently quoted in the press and spoke numerous times from the Senate floor, providing ample evidence of his position over time. Biden was a consistent critic of the way the Bush administration handled the war: Its failure to exhaust diplomatic solutions, its failure to enlist a more robust group of allies for the war effort, and the lack of a plan for reconstruction of Iraq. Some of his comments proved to be quite prescient, including his warnings about the likely higher-than-expected cost and length of the war, and the complexity of “winning the peace” once Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein’s regime was toppled. But Biden never outright opposed military action in Iraq in the immediate days after the start of the invasion, as he claimed. He now admits his recent comments went too far. Biden’s Iraq Comments in 2019 During the second Democratic primary debate on July 31, Biden said his “bad judgment” in voting to authorize President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq in 2002 was “trusting the president saying he was only doing this to get inspectors in and get the U.N. to agree to put inspectors in.” In a speech days before the 2002 vote, Bush did say approving the resolution “does not mean that military action is imminent or unavoidable,” but he also laid out in detail why military action “may” be needed. And on the day the war broke out, Biden acknowledged, “We voted to give him the authority to wage that war. We should step back and be supportive.” In the Democratic debate, Biden went on to say, “From the moment ‘shock and awe’ started, from that moment, I was opposed to the effort, and I was outspoken as much as anyone at all in the Congress and the administration.” During an interview on NPR on Sept. 3, Biden again claimed, “Immediately, the moment [shock and awe] started, I came out against the war at that moment.” Biden, Sept. 3 : I let my record stand. I think my record has been good. I think the vast majority of the foreign policy community thinks it’s been very good. For example, I got a commitment from President Bush he was not going to go to war in Iraq. He looked me in the eye in the Oval Office; he said he needed the vote to be able to get inspectors into Iraq to determine whether or not Saddam Hussein was engaged in dealing with a nuclear program. He got them in, and before we know it, we had a shock and awe. Immediately, the moment it started, I came out against the war at that moment. Now, the judgment of my trusting the president to keep his word on something like that, that was a mistake. And I apologize for that. Last month, when we reached out to the Biden campaign after Biden’s debate comment, a spokesman pointed us to comments Biden made the day before the war began and the day after. In those comments forwarded by the campaign, Biden lamented that the administration had not taken more steps toward a diplomatic solution, and warned of the need for a plan to “win the peace” after fighting ended. But Biden wasn’t against using military action against Iraq to force Iraq to give up weapons of mass destruction (which, as it turned out, it did not have). The day the war commenced, Biden told CNN : “There’s a lot of us who voted for giving the president the authority to take down Saddam Hussein if he didn’t disarm. And there are those who believe, at the end of the day, even though it wasn’t handled all that well, we still have to take him down.” During a TV interview taped for WMUR in New Hampshire on Sept. 7, Biden acknowledged that he “misspoke” in the debate and that “the misrepresentation was how quickly I said I was immediately against the war. I was against the war internally and trying to put together coalitions to try change the way in which the war was conducted.” Biden said he “argued that the way we went to war was wrong, number one. And number two, the way we were conducting the war was wrong.” The Biden campaign also provided a statement to the Washington Pos t acknowledging that “Vice President Biden misspoke by saying that he declared his opposition to the war immediately.” “He opposed the way we went to war and the way the war was being carried out,” the statement continued. “He has for many years called his vote a mistake and takes full responsibility for it. The Bush Administration assured then-Senator Biden that the purpose of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force was to strengthen our position at the U.N. Security Council to get weapons inspectors back into Iraq, and that diplomacy would be exhausted without a premature rush to war. The U.N. element of this strategy worked: after Congress passed the AUMF, the Security Council voted 15-0 to send the inspectors back and Saddam gave them access. However, the Bush Administration plunged the nation into war anyway, without allowing the inspectors to finish their job — which was profoundly misguided. Once the war began, then-Senator Biden was immediately clear in his opposition to how we got into the conflict and the way it was being conducted — including the failure to exhaust diplomacy or enlist allies, the reliance on and hyping of faulty intelligence, and the absence of a viable plan to win the peace. He was adamant that, however misguided the war, we owed it to our troops to support them, and he fought for investments like MRAPs [Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles] that saved hundreds of lives from IEDs.” Given the issue’s likely prominence in the campaign, we think it’s instructive to review some of the background and Biden’s public statements at several critical junctures. Leading Up to the Vote In a speech to the nation several days before Congress’ authorization of force vote and five months before the start of the war, the president detailed the case against Iraq, arguing that the country had violated the requirements of the truce that ended the Persian Gulf War in 1991 to “destroy its weapons of mass destruction, to cease all development of such weapons, and to stop all support for terrorist groups.” He also said Hussein was pursuing the development of nuclear weapons. All of that posed a threat to the U.S., Bush warned. “Some believe we can address this danger by simply resuming the old approach to inspections, and applying diplomatic and economic pressure,” Bush said. “Yet this is precisely what the world has tried to do since 1991.” And, he said, those methods failed. Bush, Oct. 7, 2002 : After eleven years during which we have tried containment, sanctions, inspections, even selected military action, the end result is that Saddam Hussein still has chemical and biological weapons and is increasing his capabilities to make more. And he is moving ever closer to developing a nuclear weapon. Although Bush called for new, tougher inspections and sanctions, he also made clear that war was an option. “The time for denying, deceiving, and delaying has come to an end,” Bush said. “Saddam Hussein must disarm himself — or, for the sake of peace, we will lead a coalition to disarm him.” “I hope this will not require military action, but it may,” Bush said. Biden’s Speech Prior to Vote Three days later, just prior to the vote to authorize military force, Biden gave a lengthy speech from the floor of the Senate and explained why he would vote for the resolution (beginning on S10290). Biden said he viewed the resolution not as a “rush to war,” as some of his Democratic colleagues alleged, but rather a “march to peace and security.” “I believe passage of this, with strong support, is very likely to enhance the prospects that the secretary of state will get a strong resolution out of the [United Nations] Security Council,” Biden said. Biden added that the resolution would increase the probability the U.N. would get inspectors into Iraq to do meaningful investigations of its weapons program. “I will vote for this because we should be compelling Iraq to make good on its obligations to the United Nations,” Biden said. “Because while Iraq’s illegal weapons of mass destruction program do not — do not — pose an imminent threat to our national security, in my view, they will, if left unfettered. And because a strong vote in Congress, as I said, increases the prospect for a tough, new U.N. resolution on weapons of mass destruction, it is likely to get weapons inspectors in, which, in turn, decreases the prospects of war, in my view.” Biden seized on this statement in Bush’s address to the nation: “Approving this resolution does not mean that military action is imminent or unavoidable.” Biden praised Bush for choosing, up to that point, “a course of moderation and deliberation” and noted that Bush promised that any military action would be “with allies at our side.” Biden said the resolution emphasized “the importance of international support, manifested through the United Nations Security Council.” Though Biden pushed forcefully for a wider international response, he was not opposed to military action, if necessary. “Ultimately, either those weapons must be dislodged from Iraq, or Saddam must be dislodged from power,” Biden said. It’s true, as Biden has said recently, that he saw the resolution as a means to compel Iraq to allow weapons inspectors back in. Biden, Oct. 10, 2002 : Concerning Iraq, our first step should be the one the president apparently has chosen: to get the weapons inspectors back into Iraq. … I agree with President Bush that given a new mandate and the authority to go any place, any time, with no advance warning, U.N. inspections can work. They can succeed in discovering and destroying much of Saddam’s chemical and biological arsenals and his missile program. They can delay and derail his efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and, at the very least, they will give us a clearer picture of what Saddam has, force him to focus on hiding his weapons and not building more, and it will buy us time to build a strong coalition to act if he refuses to disarm. Biden argued the resolution “would finally force Saddam to face the choice between inspectors and invaders … and there is at least a chance that he might make the right choice.” Biden also warned that the cost of a war would be much higher than most Americans believed, and that reconstruction of Iraq would be difficult, costly and likely take a decade — comments that seem prescient given how events unfolded. But again, Biden said he was not opposed to military action if diplomacy failed. “There is also a chance Saddam will once again miscalculate, that he will misjudge our resolve, and in that event we must be prepared to use force with others if we can, and alone if we must,” Biden said. The resolution passed the House 296-133 on Oct. 10, 2002. It passed the Senate the following day 77-33. U.N. Action On Nov. 8, 2002, the U.N. Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1441, which stated that Iraq was “in material breach of its obligations” regarding its disarmament agreements following the Persian Gulf War, and accused Iraq of failing to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The resolution offered Hussein “a final opportunity to comply with [Iraq’s] disarmament obligations” and set up “an enhanced inspection regime with the aim of bringing to full and verified completion the disarmament process.” The resolution gave Iraq 30 days to provide a complete declaration of “all aspects of its programmes to develop chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, and other delivery systems.” Biden hailed the move as “an important victory for American diplomacy,” and he praised Bush for “forging an international consensus on Saddam’s obligation to disarm.” “By going through the United Nations, we have gained critical international support if it becomes necessary to use force to disarm Saddam,” Biden said. In early 2003, the Bush administration began pushing for a second U.N. resolution setting a deadline for Hussein and authorizing military force if necessary to get Hussein to disarm. But the resolution was met with resistance from several key members, including France, Germany, Russia and China. In a speech before the U.N. on Feb. 5, 2003, then-Secretary of State Colin Powell said, “The facts on Iraqis’ behavior … demonstrate that Saddam Hussein and his regime have made no effort — no effort — to disarm as required by the international community. Indeed, the facts on … Iraq’s behavior show that Saddam Hussein and his regime are concealing their efforts to produce more weapons of mass destruction.” He then laid out the case for that assertion based on U.S. intelligence. In an interview hours after Powell’s speech, Biden appeared on CNN and was asked, “Did Secretary of State Powell today close the deal in your mind to those who at least have an open mind about the situation in Iraq?” “Absolutely,” Biden said. “He made a compelling case. The predominance of the evidence, the pure weight of the evidence, I think anyone. … Let me put it this way, if I were back practicing law I can’t imagine I could not convince an open-minded jury of the facts that he presented as having been true.” Biden insisted, however, that “we may be a step closer to peace. … The ball, as they say, is in Saddam’s court. … The security council’s on the line here. They’re either going to prove they are relevant or irrelevant, because I don’t think any open-minded person could argue that Saddam is not in material breach of the U.N. resolution 1441.” Biden argued in a Washington Post op-ed on March 10, 2003, that the U.S. ought to seek a second U.N. resolution giving Iraq “ more time for Iraq to meet specific disarmament demands ” but also getting a commitment from the U.N. to use force if Iraq failed to meet deadlines. Bush ultimately made the decision to go to war with Iraq, which began with the “shock and awe” bombing attack on March 19, 2003 . The U.S. was backed with troops from just four other countries: Australia, Denmark, Poland and the United Kingdom. Bush announced that the “ major military combat actions” in Iraq — officially dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom — ended on May 1, 2003. The Days Just Before and After Invasion In the hours before bombing began, Biden appeared on CNN and again warned that a large international group would be needed to successfully navigate, and help pay for, the rebuilding of Iraq once the fighting stopped. “And so that’s why I hope we begin a new round of diplomacy on, what [happens] after Saddam. Who is going to be in there with us?” Biden said. Biden was asked about comments made by fellow Democratic Sen. Tom Daschle two days prior that he was “[s] addened that we have to give up one life because this president couldn’t create the kind of diplomatic effort that was so critical for our country.” “There’s a lot of us who voted for giving the president the authority to take down Saddam Hussein if he didn’t disarm,” Biden said. “And there are those who believe, at the end of the day, even though it wasn’t handled all that well, we still have to take him down. But what you are sensing from some Democrats, as well as Republicans, is a frustration relating to the lost opportunities of maybe being able to do this with others, maybe, if we had others with us, not even having to go to war. So I don’t think it’s anything other than a frustration. “But I think it’s time we stop all that,” Biden said. “We have one single focus. And that is, we’re about to send our women and men to war. The president is the commander in chief. We voted to give him the authority to wage that war. We should step back and be supportive.” On April 2, 2003, Biden was again asked in a CNN interview about Daschle’s comments critical of Bush’s diplomatic efforts. This time, Biden said he “disagreed” with Daschle, who, like Biden, voted in favor of the authorization of force. “The way the Constitution works is, we voted to give the president the authority to go to war,” Biden said. “It’s our decision whether or not we go from a state of peace to a state of war. We gave him that authority. You can second guess whether we should have or not. Once we’ve [done] that then it’s his decision to prosecute the war. I wish he had been more successful and more earnest [in] his diplomacy. And my prayer now is … that he’ll be more successful in diplomacy of how to win the peace. But as the conduct of the war goes, that’s his call.” In an interview with Charlie Rose on March 20, 2003, the day after the start of the war, Rose asked about Biden’s comment that the war was the biggest roll of the dice by a president he had seen during his 30 years in the Senate. Biden said that comment referred to “the willingness to go without any real consensus in the world community.” Rose then asked if there was “a payoff at the end that justifies the risk” of war with Iraq. “I think there’s a payoff at the end and that is Saddam Hussein being separated from weapons of mass destruction and enforcing a U.N. commitment made by Saddam about those weapons,” Biden said. Later, Rose asked, “If in fact the war goes well, in however you define that … would you then say that George Bush made a wise decision in rolling the dice to disarm Saddam Hussein?” “I all along, Charlie, believed the right decision is to separate him from his weapons and/or separate him from power,” Biden said. “If the U.N. didn’t do it, do it?” Rose interjected. “Yes, you’ve gotta do it,” Biden said. “Now, it’s not the time to argue it, but I am disturbed at the lost opportunities we had to bring the rest of the world along with us to this point. … And now the question is … can you make lemonade out of lemons here? And I think we have an opportunity in the aftermath of this war to repair those kinds of breaches and end up where we should be anyway, which is having made the right decision to take him down, and having not fractured in any permanent way alliances and opportunities that we’re going to need available to us, Charlie, to deal with other major problems facing us in the world, from the Korean peninsula to South Asia, to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.” Biden continued to make similar comments in the months after the war started. For example, in a Brookings Institution address on July 31, 2003, Biden again defended his vote to authorize the use of military force in Iraq. The Bush administration was “ right to confront the challenge posed by Saddam thumbing his nose at the world and refusing — refusing — to alter his conduct,” Biden said . “ Contrary to what some in my party might think, Iraq was a problem that had to be dealt with sooner, rather than later. So I commend the president. He was right to enforce the solemn commitments made by Saddam. If they were not enforced … what good would they be and what value those institutions? For me, the issue was never whether we had to deal with Saddam, but when and how we dealt with Saddam. And it’s precisely the when and how that I think this administration got wrong. We went to war too soon. We went to war with too few troops. We went to war without the world, when we could have had many with us, and we’re paying the price for it now.” It wasn’t until Nov. 27, 2005, that Biden acknowledged on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that his 2002 vote authorizing force in Iraq was “a mistake.” “ It was a mistake,” Biden said. “It was a mistake to assume the president would use the authority we gave him properly. … We gave the president the authority to unite the world to isolate Saddam. And the fact of the matter is, we went too soon. We went without sufficient force. And we went without a plan .” Categories FactCheck Posts Featured Posts Tags 2020 Election Location International Issue authorizing force in Iraq Iraq war People Joe Biden Previous Story Buttigieg Wrong About Climate Change’s Effect on Oceans Next Story Meme Misleads on Walmart Gun Sales Ask FactCheck Q: Is it true the rumor that all Social Security beneficiaries will have to go to a location to verify their identity to receive their monthly check?

More Info I would like to contribute One Time Monthly Yearly Join Now Rand Paul stated on August 25, 2020 in a speech at the RNC: Says Joe Biden “voted for the Iraq War … He supported war in Serbia, Syria, Libya.” Iraq Foreign Policy Military Rand Paul Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., questions Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a Senate Foreign Relations committee hearing on the State Department's 2021 budget on Capitol Hill, July 30, 2020, in Washington. (Jim Lo Scalzo/Pool via AP) By Miriam Valverde August 26, 2020 Fact-checking Rand Paul on Joe Biden and support for wars If Your Time is short Biden as a senator voted for resolutions that supported interventions in Iraq and Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). As vice president, he followed the policies of the Obama administration, which included interventions in Syria and Libya. Biden’s campaign said that Biden as vice president supported going into Syria, but pointed to 2016 reporting that said Biden within the White House argued against intervention in Libya. See the sources for this fact-check Republican Sen. Rand Paul advocated for President Donald Trump’s re-election by portraying him as someone who wants to end wars and casting Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as someone "who consistently called for more war." "Joe Biden voted for the Iraq War, which President Trump has long called the worst geopolitical mistake of our generation," Paul said Aug. 25 during the second night of the Republican National Convention. "I fear Biden will choose war again. He supported the war in Serbia, Syria, Libya." Is the senator from Kentucky right about Biden’s record? Biden voted for a resolution that paved the way for the Iraq War, and for a non-binding resolution to authorize military air operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). The conflicts in Syria and Libya happened when Biden was vice president and followed the policies of President Barack Obama. Biden ‘voted for the Iraq War’ This checks out. In 2002, President George W. Bush argued that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein had chemical and biological weapons, sought nuclear weapons, supported terrorism, and threatened peace. In October 2002, then-U.S. Sen. Biden voted in favor of a resolution that authorized Bush to enforce ''all relevant'' United Nations Security Council resolutions on Iraq and if needed, to use military force against Iraq. Sign up for PolitiFact texts In a Senate floor speech before voting for the resolution, Biden said that "failure to overwhelmingly support" the resolution was "likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur." The objective of the resolution was to compel Iraq to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, Biden said. He left open the possibility that Hussein might "miscalculate" and "misjudge" U.S. resolve. In that event, use of military force might be needed, Biden said. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, and the war officially ended in late 2011. No weapons of mass destruction were found. In 2005, Biden was asked i n an interview if his 2002 vote was a mistake. "It was a mistake," Biden answered. "It was a mistake to assume the president would use the authority we gave him properly. … We gave the president the authority to unite the world to isolate Saddam. And the fact of the matter is, we went too soon. We went without sufficient force. And we went without a plan." RELATED : Trump still wrong on his claim that he opposed Iraq War ahead of the invasion Biden ‘supported war in Serbia, Syria, Libya’ Serbia : Biden voted for a 1999 concurrent resolution authorizing President Bill Clinton to conduct military air operations and missile strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), in cooperation with North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies. (Concurrent resolutions express the sentiment of Congress, but are not signed by the president and do not carry the force of law.) Clinton in March 1999 ordered air strikes in response to Yugoslavia’s campaign of violence against ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo. The Kosovo conflict erupted in the 1990s between two groups within the former Yugoslavia — Kosovars, who are primarily ethnic Albanians, and Serbs, who are of Slavic descent. The two groups long disputed the territory known as Kosovo. After greater Yugoslavia fractured in the early 1990s, the dispute over Kosovo became violent, pitting the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army against the Serb-dominated government of what remained of Yugoslavia. Paul’s office referenced conflicts in Syria and Libya that started in 2011, when Biden was vice president. Featured Fact-check Paul Krugman stated on November 29, 2009 in ABC's 'This Week with George Stephanopoulos' "If you want to talk firsts for Bush, this was the first time in American history that a president took us into a war and cut taxes." By Robert Farley • November 30, 2009 Syria : Syrians began protesting their government in early 2011 , calling for political and social reforms and the ouster of their president. The protests prompted a violent response from the Syrian government. The conflict escalated as different groups within the country, foreign countries, and terrorists became involved. The United States since 2011 has called for Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad to step aside. The Obama administration in 2014 launched air strikes against the Islamic State in Syria and in 2015 deployed troops there to fight the terrorist group. Biden’s campaign said the Obama-Biden administration supported the Syrian opposition in a variety of ways, including by deploying U.S. forces to combat ISIS. Libya : The United States, as part of a NATO operation, provided air support in an intervention that resulted in the ouster of the country’s longtime dictator, Moammar Gadhafi. Obama said Gadhafi was launching military actions that were causing civilian deaths and forcing ordinary Libyans to escape to neighboring countries, threatening a humanitarian crisis within Libya and instability for its neighbors, Egypt and Tunisia. The U.S. military spent about $2 billion and several months backing the Libyan uprising against Gadhafi. The uprising — part of the Arab Spring — toppled Gadhafi in August 2011, and rebel forces killed him that October. Paul’s office sent us as a 2011 fact-check of Biden as evidence for his support of the U.S. intervention. In that fact-check, we examined Biden’s claim that in Libya, "America spent $2 billion total and didn’t lose a single life." We rated that Mostly True. (The fact-check did not focus on Biden’s own position on the issue.) Biden’s campaign, however, pointed to a 2016 Politico report that referenced an interview Biden gave to journalist Charlie Rose in which he said that intervening in Libya was wrong. The Politico story said that Biden told Rose that he had "argued strongly" within the White House "against going ... to Libya." Politico reported that Biden in that interview also said the United States should not use force unless the interests of the country or its allies are directly threatened, whether it can be done "efficaciously" and whether it can be sustained. Our ruling Paul said Biden, "Voted for the Iraq war … He supported war in Serbia, Syria, Libya." Biden as a senator voted for resolutions that supported interventions in Iraq and Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). As vice president, he followed the policies of the Obama administration, which included interventions in Syria and Libya. Biden’s campaign said that Biden as vice president supported going into Syria, but pointed to 2016 reporting that said Biden within the White House argued against intervention in Libya. Paul’s claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True. Read About Our Process The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter Our Sources Email interview, Sen.

The directive instructs Attorney General Pam Bondi to, within 30 days, “examine all orders, regulations, guidance, plans, international agreements, and other actions of executive departments and agencies (agencies) to assess any ongoing infringements of the Second Amendment rights of our citizens, and present a proposed plan of action to the President, through the Domestic Policy Advisor, to protect the Second Amendment rights of all Americans.” The review will be sweeping. At a minimum, key areas for scrutiny will include: Presidential and agency actions that may have restricted firearm rights. Rulemakings by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) that implicate the Second Amendment. Reports and policies from the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. The Government’s legal positions in litigation implicating the Second Amendment. Agency firearm and ammunition classification policies. The processing of applications to make, manufacture, transfer, or export firearms. After Attorney General Bondi submits her proposal, DOJ will work with the domestic policy advisor to finalize and, ultimately, implement the plan of action. This could result in a broad unwinding of the Biden Administration’s firearms policies. Takeaways This action by the President appears to be the first Executive Order in American history focused on enhancing Second Amendment rights. As a result, federal firearms licensees should expect to see ATF’s enforcement priorities change in the coming months. While the ultimate outcome of the Executive Order will be unknown for the near future, some of the biggest targets for the new Administration could include: ATF’s pistol brace rule that classified pistols equipped with stabilizing braces as “short-barreled rifles” under the National Firearms Act (NFA). Last year, the Eighth Circuit rejected that rule and its factors in FRAC v. Garland , 112 F.4th 507 (8th Cir. 2024), and the rule remains inoperative. ATF’s Frame or Receiver rule that interpreted federal firearms statutes to restrict partially completed frames or receivers, such as parts kits, under the NFA and Gun Control Act (GCA). ATF’s Zero Tolerance Policy that requires inspectors to revoke the federal firearms license of American gun stores over simple paperwork errors and other non-willful violations of the GCA. The process by which ATF issues firearms and ammunition classification letters. ATF’s Engaged in the Business rule , an agency interpretation that broadens the definition of “firearms dealer.” NFA form processing to limit unnecessary delays for applicants.

Mr Biden says he will not take money away from police forces. He wants to invest in community projects and social programmes to lessen the burden on the police. There have been calls to divert money from the police to spend on other services, after the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer in May. What has Biden promised on police funding? A statement from Mr Biden's communications team on 8 June said he supported the need for reform, focusing on funding educational programmes as well as mental health and drug abuse treatment projects, to allow police officers to focus on the job of policing. These programmes should be separate from funding for the police, it says. Mr Biden's campaign website also pledges a $300m investment in community policing, which would be conditional on hiring police officers who "mirror the racial diversity of the community". He also proposes additional funding for body-worn cameras for the police. Seven ideas for reforming the US police In an interview with CBS News in June, Mr Biden said he didn't support defunding the police, adding: "I support conditioning federal aid to police, based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency..." Mr Biden also wrote an opinion piece that month in USA Today, stating: "While I do not believe federal dollars should go to police departments violating people's rights or turning to violence as the first resort, I do not support defunding police." Why is Biden accused of supporting defunding? An interview Mr Biden gave in July led to accusations that he did support taking money from the police, after an edited version was posted on Twitter by Republican Congressman Steve Scalise. In this version, Mr Biden answers "Yes" to a question about whether he agrees with redirecting funding. President Trump referred to this when addressing the Republican Party convention, adding that if Mr Biden became president "the radical left will defund police departments across America." Getty Images A police officer on the scene of protests in Philadelphia But the video as posted by Mr Scalise was flagged by Twitter as manipulated because of the way the words "for police" were edited into the question about funding . In the unedited original, the interviewer, Ady Barkan says: "We can reduce the responsibilities assigned to the police and redirect some of the funding for police into social services, mental health counselling, and affordable housing." Joe Biden begins talking about various types of police reforms he wants to see, when Mr Barkan interrupts to ask: "But do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding?" He doesn't mention the word "police" in the question, but Mr Biden anyway responds: "Yes, absolutely." Republican Steve Scalise deleted his Twitter post with the video clip, but defended his view that Mr Biden was talking about police funding. The Biden campaign called the edited video a "deep fake." Who does support defunding the police? There are some high-profile Democrats who support a reduction in funding. New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is among the proponents of defunding police departments and reinvesting the money in local communities. New York mayor Bill de Blasio has moved to cut $1 billion from the city's police department budget, shifting the funds to youth programmes - although Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez has said this was achieved through "budget tricks". A simple guide to the US election Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues? How you can be US president without winning most votes The Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, has taken $150m from the police department budget to spend on other local programmes. In other cities, such as Washington DC, San Francisco and Baltimore, local policymakers have declared their support for some form of defunding. Seven ideas for reforming the US police Are US cities seeing a surge in violent crime? And in Minneapolis, the city council has pledged to dismantle the entire police department, although it's not yet clear what would replace it. The Black Lives Matter movement has begun a petition to defund the police, saying: "We call for a national defunding of police. We demand investment in our communities and the resources to ensure Black people not only survive, but thrive." Supporters of defunding believe that more spending on education, housing and healthcare, rather than law enforcement, would help reduce crime, meaning fewer police officers would be needed. But critics argue that defunding won't address the reforms that are needed to police training and procedures, or improve how the police operate in the community. They also say that simply taking away money from police forces could leave people living in areas suffering high crime rates even more vulnerable. How much money do police departments get? Most of the spending on police departments actually comes directly from local governments, with the rest coming from federal government grants. The latest data compiled by the Washington-based Urban Institute research organisation, shows around $115 billion was spent on policing across the US in 2017. This amount has consistently grown over the last 50 years. Overall, crime rates have been dropping across the country since the 1990s, although in some US cities murder rates are up this year compared with last year. A recent poll found that 60% of Americans opposed reducing the budgets of police departments and re-allocating the money to other social programmes.

Mr Biden says he will not take money away from police forces. He wants to invest in community projects and social programmes to lessen the burden on the police. There have been calls to divert money from the police to spend on other services, after the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer in May. What has Biden promised on police funding? A statement from Mr Biden's communications team on 8 June said he supported the need for reform, focusing on funding educational programmes as well as mental health and drug abuse treatment projects, to allow police officers to focus on the job of policing. These programmes should be separate from funding for the police, it says. Mr Biden's campaign website also pledges a $300m investment in community policing, which would be conditional on hiring police officers who "mirror the racial diversity of the community". He also proposes additional funding for body-worn cameras for the police. Seven ideas for reforming the US police In an interview with CBS News in June, Mr Biden said he didn't support defunding the police, adding: "I support conditioning federal aid to police, based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency..." Mr Biden also wrote an opinion piece that month in USA Today, stating: "While I do not believe federal dollars should go to police departments violating people's rights or turning to violence as the first resort, I do not support defunding police." Why is Biden accused of supporting defunding? An interview Mr Biden gave in July led to accusations that he did support taking money from the police, after an edited version was posted on Twitter by Republican Congressman Steve Scalise. In this version, Mr Biden answers "Yes" to a question about whether he agrees with redirecting funding. President Trump referred to this when addressing the Republican Party convention, adding that if Mr Biden became president "the radical left will defund police departments across America." Getty Images A police officer on the scene of protests in Philadelphia But the video as posted by Mr Scalise was flagged by Twitter as manipulated because of the way the words "for police" were edited into the question about funding . In the unedited original, the interviewer, Ady Barkan says: "We can reduce the responsibilities assigned to the police and redirect some of the funding for police into social services, mental health counselling, and affordable housing." Joe Biden begins talking about various types of police reforms he wants to see, when Mr Barkan interrupts to ask: "But do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding?" He doesn't mention the word "police" in the question, but Mr Biden anyway responds: "Yes, absolutely." Republican Steve Scalise deleted his Twitter post with the video clip, but defended his view that Mr Biden was talking about police funding. The Biden campaign called the edited video a "deep fake." Who does support defunding the police? There are some high-profile Democrats who support a reduction in funding. New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is among the proponents of defunding police departments and reinvesting the money in local communities. New York mayor Bill de Blasio has moved to cut $1 billion from the city's police department budget, shifting the funds to youth programmes - although Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez has said this was achieved through "budget tricks". A simple guide to the US election Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues? How you can be US president without winning most votes The Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, has taken $150m from the police department budget to spend on other local programmes. In other cities, such as Washington DC, San Francisco and Baltimore, local policymakers have declared their support for some form of defunding. Seven ideas for reforming the US police Are US cities seeing a surge in violent crime? And in Minneapolis, the city council has pledged to dismantle the entire police department, although it's not yet clear what would replace it. The Black Lives Matter movement has begun a petition to defund the police, saying: "We call for a national defunding of police.

Verdict One correct, two incorrect Source Kenya’s former prime minister Raila Odinga (August 2020) This article is more than 4 years old Since 2004 Nigeria’s revenue sharing formula has given 52.68% to the federal government, 26.72% to states and 20.60% to local governments. Odinga was correct about local governments’ share, but wide of the mark for the other two government levels. And experts question his claim that Nigeria’s system “works perfectly well”. After months of an often fractious stalemate , in September 2020 Kenya’s senate hammered out a deal on how revenue would be shared between the country’s two levels of government. In August, at the height of the deadlock, former prime minister Odinga returned to a familiar talking point to argue for establishing a third tier of government. Building on this in an interview with Citizen TV , Odinga, who is also an African Union envoy , said Kenya could solve the recurring battle over how to share revenue if it looked to Nigeria for lessons. Nigeria, he said, had a local, state and federal system of government. “In terms of revenue share, 20% of the revenue goes to the local, 35% goes to the state and 45% goes to the federal governments ... and it works perfectly well,” Odinga said . We checked if he was on the mark about how revenue is shared in Africa’s largest economy . Claim In Nigeria … in terms of revenue share, 20% goes to the local government. Verdict correct We asked Dennis Onyango, Odinga’s spokesperson, for the source of the former leader’s claims. We will update this report with his response. In line with its constitution , Nigeria has a federal capital authority, 36 states and 768 local government authorities. There are also six area councils. The Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission proposes a formula for how revenue is to be shared between the three levels. This is then approved by the national assembly . The revenue formula was first used in 1982 when the Nigeria Revenue Allocation Act came into effect. The law stipulated that 56% of funds would go to the federal government, 24% to states and 20% to local governments. The current formula can be traced to a March 2004 circular from the finance ministry. It has remained at these levels since. “The revenue allocation formula is still 52.68%, 26.72% and 20.6%,” Prof Sherifdeen Tella, professor of economics at Olabisi Onabanjo University told Africa Check. Before the revenue is split an amount “not less than 13%” is deducted and shared among the oil producing states based on their production levels. According to data from Nigeria's extractive industries transparency initiative , a government agency supervised by the president’s office, local governments get 20.6% of national revenue. We therefore rate Odinga as correct on this claim. Recent local government allocations at 20% The most recent full year data from the budget office shows that in 2019, local governments received N1.04 trillion of the N5.05 trillion available for sharing among the three levels of government. And in the first quarter of 2020, local governments got N441.44 billion of the N2.14 trillion available. Both these amounts work out to about 20% for local governments. (Note: Value-added tax is also shared among the three levels of government, using a different formula. Local governments get 35% of VAT revenue, state governments 50% and the federal government 15%.) Claim 35% of revenue goes to states. Verdict incorrect Data from Nigeria's extractive industries transparency initiative shows that 26.72% is reserved for the state governments, not the 35% Odinga claimed. We therefore rate this claim as incorrect. In 2019, of the N5.05 trillion available for sharing, states got N1.35 trillion. In the first quarter of 2020, states received N572.59 billion of the N2.14 trillion available. Both these allocations work out to 26.72%, in keeping with the formula. Claim 45% of revenue goes to the federal governments. Verdict incorrect Odinga’s claim of 45% is not accurate. Official data shows the federal government gets more than half of the total revenue. In 2019, data from the budget office shows the federal government received N2.66 trillion of the N5.05 trillion available for sharing. In the first quarter of 2020 it got N1.13 trillion out of N2.14 trillion. These amounts tally with the 52.68% set out in the sharing formula. Does Nigeria’s revenue sharing model work ‘perfectly well’? Raila Odinga’s assertion that the Nigerian revenue sharing formula “works perfectly” is contested. Gazie Okpara , a professor of marketing at Abia State University in southeast Nigeria whose interests include social policy, said the formula was imperfect because how the funds were spent was not transparent. “Each level of government should always give an account of how funds were spent,” he said, an audit that should be provided for in the constitution. Prof Sherifdeen Tella, a professor of economics at Olabisi Onabanjo University in southwestern Nigeria, told Africa Check that in his view, allocations to state and local governments, and especially the former, should be increased. “What is allocated to these two tiers of government is not sufficient.” Matthew Akintayo is a professor at the University of Ibadan , also in southwestern Nigeria. One of his focus areas is the economics of education. He told Africa Check that the sharing formula should be restructured. “A bulk or vast fraction of resources should be allocated to the state and local government because both arms of government are closer to the grassroots,” he said. He added that state governors should be given more leeway to manage their resources. John Kinuthia, a senior programme officer at the International Budget Partnership , told Africa Check that Odinga should also have considered the nature of devolved functions when drawing comparisons. It was difficult to compare Kenyan counties with Nigerian states, partly because they had different functions, Kinuthia said. He gave the example of education. “In Nigeria there are functions like education that are devolved, which is why you see a bigger proportion of resources at the subnational level compared to Kenya. In Kenya, education is still at the national level.” Republish our content for free We believe that everyone needs the facts.

Ad Feedback Business Economy • 6 min read US economy goes into reverse from Trump’s abrupt policy shifts By Bryan Mena , CNN 6 minute read Updated 11:53 AM EDT, Wed April 30, 2025 Link Copied! Follow: Donald Trump See your latest updates The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta forecast a sharp decline of 2.7% for US GDP in the first quarter of 2025. That would mark the worst quarter since the Covid era in mid-2020. Myung J. Chun/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images Washington CNN — The US economy just had its worst quarter since 2022 as President Donald Trump’s significant policy changes unnerved consumers and businesses. Gross domestic product, which measures all the goods and services produced in the economy, registered at an annualized rate of -0.3% in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That’s a sharp slowdown from the fourth quarter’s 2.4% rate, and much worse than the 0.8% rate economists projected. GDP is adjusted for seasonal swings and inflation. US stocks dropped after the GDP report was released. The Trump administration has been on a chaotic tariff spree over the past several months, escalating trade tensions with China and unsettling Americans . Most economists say Trump’s monumental bid to reshape global trade is likely to send inflation climbing in the United States and even trigger a recession. The president, however, deflected blame from the weak figures reflected in the first economic report card of his second term. “Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden ‘Overhang.’” he wrote Wednesday in a post on social media. “This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS, only that he left us with bad numbers, but when the boom begins, it will be like no other. BE PATIENT!!!” During a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, Trump reiterated that stance: “That’s Biden, that’s not Trump.” The economy’s decline in the beginning of the year was driven by a wider trade deficit — a result of Americans front-running purchases to beat Trump’s tariffs — and cutbacks in government spending, according to a release. Imports skyrocketed from -1.9% in the fourth quarter to 41.3% in the first three months of the year. Meanwhile, exports registered at a 1.8% rate. When imports exceed exports, that subtracts from GDP and that was by far the biggest drag on growth in the first quarter. The difference between imports and exports subtracted from GDP by the most on records going back to 1947. Trump’s top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, called the GDP report “the best negative print I have ever seen in my life.” “The markets need to look beneath the surface,” Navarro said Wednesday in a CNBC interview, pointing to the sharp increase in domestic investment last quarter. However, much of that came from businesses increasing their inventories ahead of tariffs, the Commerce Department said. Details from the report There were several signs of weakness in the first GDP report of Trump’s second term, but it wasn’t all doom and gloom. Consumer spending, which powers about 70% of the US economy, slowed sharply in the first quarter to a 1.8% rate, down considerably from 4% in the prior three-month period. That slowdown was largely due to Americans cutting their spending on goods, and was the weakest rate since mid-2023. Government spending also weighed on the economy, with federal outlays dropping to -5.1% from 4% during the same period. Meanwhile, businesses actually stepped up their spending, likely to get ahead of any expected price increases stemming from Trump’s tariffs. Business investment in the first quarter expanded at a 9.8% rate, up sharply from -3% in the fourth quarter. Gross private domestic investment was 21.9% in the January-through-March period, the highest rate since late 2021. Stephen Miran, chair of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN’s Pamela Brown that the uptick in business investment is “not what firms do when they’re concerned about the economic outlook.” In a shred of goods news, final sales to private domestic purchasers — a key gauge of underlying demand in the economy — accelerated to 3% in the first quarter from 2.9% in the fourth quarter. The White House pointed to that figure as a sign of “strong underlying economic momentum that occurred after President Trump’s inauguration.” “It’s no surprise the leftovers of Biden’s economic disaster have been a drag on economic growth, but the underlying numbers tell the real story of the strong momentum President Trump is delivering,” Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said in a statement. She added that economic developments over the past few months are “fueling an economic boom and setting the stage for unprecedented growth as President Trump ushers in the new Golden Age.” Wednesday’s report also showed that inflation took a sharper than expected upswing during the first quarter. The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index rose an estimated 3.6% for the quarter, up from 2.4% during the fourth quarter, according to the report. Excluding food and energy prices, the core PCE index increased 3.5% versus 2.6% the quarter before. We can’t call it a recession yet While the latest GDP report points to a much weaker economy compared to last year, that doesn’t necessarily mean Americans are in the throes of a recession just yet. A recession is technically defined as a broad-based contraction in the economy — encompassing the labor market, consumer spending, industrial activity and business investment — that lasts for more than a few months. And even though it may feel like there is a recession, according to polls and surveys , the economy remains in good shape on a few important fronts. Pedestrians outside of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, on January 28, 2025. Michael Nagle/Bloomberg/Getty Images Related article Americans fear an imminent recession. That may be enough to put us in one Unemployment remains relatively low — 4.2% as of March — businesses are continuing to invest in their operations and consumers haven’t retreated with their spending in any meaningful way just yet, government data shows. Still, the economy can quickly take a turn for the worse, especially if Trump ups the ante on his tariff blitz. “I don’t think we can call a recession from this data right now but it is a sign that we’re on this razor-thin edge where the longer the tariffs remain in place the more likely we are headed for an economic downturn,” Gregory Daco, chief economist at Ernst & Young, told CNN’s Matt Egan. A separate report released Wednesday showed a precipitous drop-off in hiring by businesses in the US private sector, which doesn’t bode well for economic growth in the future. Employers added just 62,000 jobs in April, according to payroll company ADP’s latest monthly report released Wednesday morning. That’s well below the 147,000 jobs added in March. “Unease is the word of the day. Employers are trying to reconcile policy and consumer uncertainty with a run of mostly positive economic data,” Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, said in a statement. “It can be difficult to make hiring decisions in such an environment.” A rule of thumb for defining a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative GDP, which hasn’t happened yet. The National Bureau of Economic Research is the official recession arbiter, though the group’s call can come many months after a recession has officially started. The last time the US economy was in a recession was in 2020, which lasted just two months and was spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic. Before that, it was the Great Recession, which lasted from December 2007 through June 2009 and was the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression.

More Info I would like to contribute One Time Monthly Yearly Join Now Rand Paul stated on August 25, 2020 in a speech at the RNC: Says Joe Biden “voted for the Iraq War … He supported war in Serbia, Syria, Libya.” Iraq Foreign Policy Military Rand Paul Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., questions Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a Senate Foreign Relations committee hearing on the State Department's 2021 budget on Capitol Hill, July 30, 2020, in Washington. (Jim Lo Scalzo/Pool via AP) By Miriam Valverde August 26, 2020 Fact-checking Rand Paul on Joe Biden and support for wars If Your Time is short Biden as a senator voted for resolutions that supported interventions in Iraq and Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). As vice president, he followed the policies of the Obama administration, which included interventions in Syria and Libya. Biden’s campaign said that Biden as vice president supported going into Syria, but pointed to 2016 reporting that said Biden within the White House argued against intervention in Libya. See the sources for this fact-check Republican Sen. Rand Paul advocated for President Donald Trump’s re-election by portraying him as someone who wants to end wars and casting Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as someone "who consistently called for more war." "Joe Biden voted for the Iraq War, which President Trump has long called the worst geopolitical mistake of our generation," Paul said Aug. 25 during the second night of the Republican National Convention. "I fear Biden will choose war again. He supported the war in Serbia, Syria, Libya." Is the senator from Kentucky right about Biden’s record? Biden voted for a resolution that paved the way for the Iraq War, and for a non-binding resolution to authorize military air operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). The conflicts in Syria and Libya happened when Biden was vice president and followed the policies of President Barack Obama. Biden ‘voted for the Iraq War’ This checks out. In 2002, President George W. Bush argued that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein had chemical and biological weapons, sought nuclear weapons, supported terrorism, and threatened peace. In October 2002, then-U.S. Sen. Biden voted in favor of a resolution that authorized Bush to enforce ''all relevant'' United Nations Security Council resolutions on Iraq and if needed, to use military force against Iraq. Sign up for PolitiFact texts In a Senate floor speech before voting for the resolution, Biden said that "failure to overwhelmingly support" the resolution was "likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur." The objective of the resolution was to compel Iraq to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, Biden said. He left open the possibility that Hussein might "miscalculate" and "misjudge" U.S. resolve. In that event, use of military force might be needed, Biden said. The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, and the war officially ended in late 2011. No weapons of mass destruction were found. In 2005, Biden was asked i n an interview if his 2002 vote was a mistake. "It was a mistake," Biden answered. "It was a mistake to assume the president would use the authority we gave him properly. … We gave the president the authority to unite the world to isolate Saddam. And the fact of the matter is, we went too soon. We went without sufficient force. And we went without a plan." RELATED : Trump still wrong on his claim that he opposed Iraq War ahead of the invasion Biden ‘supported war in Serbia, Syria, Libya’ Serbia : Biden voted for a 1999 concurrent resolution authorizing President Bill Clinton to conduct military air operations and missile strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), in cooperation with North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies. (Concurrent resolutions express the sentiment of Congress, but are not signed by the president and do not carry the force of law.) Clinton in March 1999 ordered air strikes in response to Yugoslavia’s campaign of violence against ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo. The Kosovo conflict erupted in the 1990s between two groups within the former Yugoslavia — Kosovars, who are primarily ethnic Albanians, and Serbs, who are of Slavic descent. The two groups long disputed the territory known as Kosovo. After greater Yugoslavia fractured in the early 1990s, the dispute over Kosovo became violent, pitting the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army against the Serb-dominated government of what remained of Yugoslavia. Paul’s office referenced conflicts in Syria and Libya that started in 2011, when Biden was vice president. Featured Fact-check Paul Krugman stated on November 29, 2009 in ABC's 'This Week with George Stephanopoulos' "If you want to talk firsts for Bush, this was the first time in American history that a president took us into a war and cut taxes." By Robert Farley • November 30, 2009 Syria : Syrians began protesting their government in early 2011 , calling for political and social reforms and the ouster of their president. The protests prompted a violent response from the Syrian government. The conflict escalated as different groups within the country, foreign countries, and terrorists became involved. The United States since 2011 has called for Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad to step aside. The Obama administration in 2014 launched air strikes against the Islamic State in Syria and in 2015 deployed troops there to fight the terrorist group. Biden’s campaign said the Obama-Biden administration supported the Syrian opposition in a variety of ways, including by deploying U.S. forces to combat ISIS. Libya : The United States, as part of a NATO operation, provided air support in an intervention that resulted in the ouster of the country’s longtime dictator, Moammar Gadhafi. Obama said Gadhafi was launching military actions that were causing civilian deaths and forcing ordinary Libyans to escape to neighboring countries, threatening a humanitarian crisis within Libya and instability for its neighbors, Egypt and Tunisia. The U.S. military spent about $2 billion and several months backing the Libyan uprising against Gadhafi. The uprising — part of the Arab Spring — toppled Gadhafi in August 2011, and rebel forces killed him that October. Paul’s office sent us as a 2011 fact-check of Biden as evidence for his support of the U.S. intervention. In that fact-check, we examined Biden’s claim that in Libya, "America spent $2 billion total and didn’t lose a single life." We rated that Mostly True. (The fact-check did not focus on Biden’s own position on the issue.) Biden’s campaign, however, pointed to a 2016 Politico report that referenced an interview Biden gave to journalist Charlie Rose in which he said that intervening in Libya was wrong. The Politico story said that Biden told Rose that he had "argued strongly" within the White House "against going ... to Libya." Politico reported that Biden in that interview also said the United States should not use force unless the interests of the country or its allies are directly threatened, whether it can be done "efficaciously" and whether it can be sustained. Our ruling Paul said Biden, "Voted for the Iraq war … He supported war in Serbia, Syria, Libya." Biden as a senator voted for resolutions that supported interventions in Iraq and Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). As vice president, he followed the policies of the Obama administration, which included interventions in Syria and Libya. Biden’s campaign said that Biden as vice president supported going into Syria, but pointed to 2016 reporting that said Biden within the White House argued against intervention in Libya. Paul’s claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True. Read About Our Process The Principles of the Truth-O-Meter Our Sources Email interview, Sen.

That’s not accurate, and Biden now says he misspoke. The public position taken in the lead-up to and early days of the Iraq war has been a litmus test for many presidential candidates. Sen. Bernie Sanders proudly boasts about his vote — while serving as a member of the House in late 2002 — against authorizing use of military force against Iraq. While running for president, Donald Trump repeatedly claimed that he publicly opposed the Iraq war before the March 19, 2003, invasion, though we looked into it and could find no evidence that he ever did. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when the authorization vote was cast, Biden was at the forefront of the debate about what course to pursue with Iraq. As a result, he was also frequently quoted in the press and spoke numerous times from the Senate floor, providing ample evidence of his position over time. Biden was a consistent critic of the way the Bush administration handled the war: Its failure to exhaust diplomatic solutions, its failure to enlist a more robust group of allies for the war effort, and the lack of a plan for reconstruction of Iraq. Some of his comments proved to be quite prescient, including his warnings about the likely higher-than-expected cost and length of the war, and the complexity of “winning the peace” once Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein’s regime was toppled. But Biden never outright opposed military action in Iraq in the immediate days after the start of the invasion, as he claimed. He now admits his recent comments went too far. Biden’s Iraq Comments in 2019 During the second Democratic primary debate on July 31, Biden said his “bad judgment” in voting to authorize President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq in 2002 was “trusting the president saying he was only doing this to get inspectors in and get the U.N. to agree to put inspectors in.” In a speech days before the 2002 vote, Bush did say approving the resolution “does not mean that military action is imminent or unavoidable,” but he also laid out in detail why military action “may” be needed. And on the day the war broke out, Biden acknowledged, “We voted to give him the authority to wage that war. We should step back and be supportive.” In the Democratic debate, Biden went on to say, “From the moment ‘shock and awe’ started, from that moment, I was opposed to the effort, and I was outspoken as much as anyone at all in the Congress and the administration.” During an interview on NPR on Sept. 3, Biden again claimed, “Immediately, the moment [shock and awe] started, I came out against the war at that moment.” Biden, Sept. 3 : I let my record stand. I think my record has been good. I think the vast majority of the foreign policy community thinks it’s been very good. For example, I got a commitment from President Bush he was not going to go to war in Iraq. He looked me in the eye in the Oval Office; he said he needed the vote to be able to get inspectors into Iraq to determine whether or not Saddam Hussein was engaged in dealing with a nuclear program. He got them in, and before we know it, we had a shock and awe. Immediately, the moment it started, I came out against the war at that moment. Now, the judgment of my trusting the president to keep his word on something like that, that was a mistake. And I apologize for that. Last month, when we reached out to the Biden campaign after Biden’s debate comment, a spokesman pointed us to comments Biden made the day before the war began and the day after. In those comments forwarded by the campaign, Biden lamented that the administration had not taken more steps toward a diplomatic solution, and warned of the need for a plan to “win the peace” after fighting ended. But Biden wasn’t against using military action against Iraq to force Iraq to give up weapons of mass destruction (which, as it turned out, it did not have). The day the war commenced, Biden told CNN : “There’s a lot of us who voted for giving the president the authority to take down Saddam Hussein if he didn’t disarm. And there are those who believe, at the end of the day, even though it wasn’t handled all that well, we still have to take him down.” During a TV interview taped for WMUR in New Hampshire on Sept. 7, Biden acknowledged that he “misspoke” in the debate and that “the misrepresentation was how quickly I said I was immediately against the war. I was against the war internally and trying to put together coalitions to try change the way in which the war was conducted.” Biden said he “argued that the way we went to war was wrong, number one. And number two, the way we were conducting the war was wrong.” The Biden campaign also provided a statement to the Washington Pos t acknowledging that “Vice President Biden misspoke by saying that he declared his opposition to the war immediately.” “He opposed the way we went to war and the way the war was being carried out,” the statement continued. “He has for many years called his vote a mistake and takes full responsibility for it. The Bush Administration assured then-Senator Biden that the purpose of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force was to strengthen our position at the U.N. Security Council to get weapons inspectors back into Iraq, and that diplomacy would be exhausted without a premature rush to war. The U.N. element of this strategy worked: after Congress passed the AUMF, the Security Council voted 15-0 to send the inspectors back and Saddam gave them access. However, the Bush Administration plunged the nation into war anyway, without allowing the inspectors to finish their job — which was profoundly misguided. Once the war began, then-Senator Biden was immediately clear in his opposition to how we got into the conflict and the way it was being conducted — including the failure to exhaust diplomacy or enlist allies, the reliance on and hyping of faulty intelligence, and the absence of a viable plan to win the peace. He was adamant that, however misguided the war, we owed it to our troops to support them, and he fought for investments like MRAPs [Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles] that saved hundreds of lives from IEDs.” Given the issue’s likely prominence in the campaign, we think it’s instructive to review some of the background and Biden’s public statements at several critical junctures. Leading Up to the Vote In a speech to the nation several days before Congress’ authorization of force vote and five months before the start of the war, the president detailed the case against Iraq, arguing that the country had violated the requirements of the truce that ended the Persian Gulf War in 1991 to “destroy its weapons of mass destruction, to cease all development of such weapons, and to stop all support for terrorist groups.” He also said Hussein was pursuing the development of nuclear weapons. All of that posed a threat to the U.S., Bush warned. “Some believe we can address this danger by simply resuming the old approach to inspections, and applying diplomatic and economic pressure,” Bush said. “Yet this is precisely what the world has tried to do since 1991.” And, he said, those methods failed. Bush, Oct. 7, 2002 : After eleven years during which we have tried containment, sanctions, inspections, even selected military action, the end result is that Saddam Hussein still has chemical and biological weapons and is increasing his capabilities to make more. And he is moving ever closer to developing a nuclear weapon. Although Bush called for new, tougher inspections and sanctions, he also made clear that war was an option. “The time for denying, deceiving, and delaying has come to an end,” Bush said. “Saddam Hussein must disarm himself — or, for the sake of peace, we will lead a coalition to disarm him.” “I hope this will not require military action, but it may,” Bush said. Biden’s Speech Prior to Vote Three days later, just prior to the vote to authorize military force, Biden gave a lengthy speech from the floor of the Senate and explained why he would vote for the resolution (beginning on S10290). Biden said he viewed the resolution not as a “rush to war,” as some of his Democratic colleagues alleged, but rather a “march to peace and security.” “I believe passage of this, with strong support, is very likely to enhance the prospects that the secretary of state will get a strong resolution out of the [United Nations] Security Council,” Biden said. Biden added that the resolution would increase the probability the U.N. would get inspectors into Iraq to do meaningful investigations of its weapons program. “I will vote for this because we should be compelling Iraq to make good on its obligations to the United Nations,” Biden said. “Because while Iraq’s illegal weapons of mass destruction program do not — do not — pose an imminent threat to our national security, in my view, they will, if left unfettered. And because a strong vote in Congress, as I said, increases the prospect for a tough, new U.N. resolution on weapons of mass destruction, it is likely to get weapons inspectors in, which, in turn, decreases the prospects of war, in my view.” Biden seized on this statement in Bush’s address to the nation: “Approving this resolution does not mean that military action is imminent or unavoidable.” Biden praised Bush for choosing, up to that point, “a course of moderation and deliberation” and noted that Bush promised that any military action would be “with allies at our side.” Biden said the resolution emphasized “the importance of international support, manifested through the United Nations Security Council.” Though Biden pushed forcefully for a wider international response, he was not opposed to military action, if necessary. “Ultimately, either those weapons must be dislodged from Iraq, or Saddam must be dislodged from power,” Biden said. It’s true, as Biden has said recently, that he saw the resolution as a means to compel Iraq to allow weapons inspectors back in. Biden, Oct. 10, 2002 : Concerning Iraq, our first step should be the one the president apparently has chosen: to get the weapons inspectors back into Iraq. … I agree with President Bush that given a new mandate and the authority to go any place, any time, with no advance warning, U.N. inspections can work. They can succeed in discovering and destroying much of Saddam’s chemical and biological arsenals and his missile program. They can delay and derail his efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and, at the very least, they will give us a clearer picture of what Saddam has, force him to focus on hiding his weapons and not building more, and it will buy us time to build a strong coalition to act if he refuses to disarm. Biden argued the resolution “would finally force Saddam to face the choice between inspectors and invaders … and there is at least a chance that he might make the right choice.” Biden also warned that the cost of a war would be much higher than most Americans believed, and that reconstruction of Iraq would be difficult, costly and likely take a decade — comments that seem prescient given how events unfolded. But again, Biden said he was not opposed to military action if diplomacy failed. “There is also a chance Saddam will once again miscalculate, that he will misjudge our resolve, and in that event we must be prepared to use force with others if we can, and alone if we must,” Biden said. The resolution passed the House 296-133 on Oct. 10, 2002. It passed the Senate the following day 77-33. U.N. Action On Nov. 8, 2002, the U.N. Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1441, which stated that Iraq was “in material breach of its obligations” regarding its disarmament agreements following the Persian Gulf War, and accused Iraq of failing to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors and the International Atomic Energy Agency. The resolution offered Hussein “a final opportunity to comply with [Iraq’s] disarmament obligations” and set up “an enhanced inspection regime with the aim of bringing to full and verified completion the disarmament process.” The resolution gave Iraq 30 days to provide a complete declaration of “all aspects of its programmes to develop chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, and other delivery systems.” Biden hailed the move as “an important victory for American diplomacy,” and he praised Bush for “forging an international consensus on Saddam’s obligation to disarm.” “By going through the United Nations, we have gained critical international support if it becomes necessary to use force to disarm Saddam,” Biden said. In early 2003, the Bush administration began pushing for a second U.N. resolution setting a deadline for Hussein and authorizing military force if necessary to get Hussein to disarm. But the resolution was met with resistance from several key members, including France, Germany, Russia and China. In a speech before the U.N. on Feb. 5, 2003, then-Secretary of State Colin Powell said, “The facts on Iraqis’ behavior … demonstrate that Saddam Hussein and his regime have made no effort — no effort — to disarm as required by the international community. Indeed, the facts on … Iraq’s behavior show that Saddam Hussein and his regime are concealing their efforts to produce more weapons of mass destruction.” He then laid out the case for that assertion based on U.S. intelligence. In an interview hours after Powell’s speech, Biden appeared on CNN and was asked, “Did Secretary of State Powell today close the deal in your mind to those who at least have an open mind about the situation in Iraq?” “Absolutely,” Biden said. “He made a compelling case. The predominance of the evidence, the pure weight of the evidence, I think anyone. … Let me put it this way, if I were back practicing law I can’t imagine I could not convince an open-minded jury of the facts that he presented as having been true.” Biden insisted, however, that “we may be a step closer to peace. … The ball, as they say, is in Saddam’s court. … The security council’s on the line here. They’re either going to prove they are relevant or irrelevant, because I don’t think any open-minded person could argue that Saddam is not in material breach of the U.N. resolution 1441.” Biden argued in a Washington Post op-ed on March 10, 2003, that the U.S. ought to seek a second U.N. resolution giving Iraq “ more time for Iraq to meet specific disarmament demands ” but also getting a commitment from the U.N. to use force if Iraq failed to meet deadlines. Bush ultimately made the decision to go to war with Iraq, which began with the “shock and awe” bombing attack on March 19, 2003 . The U.S. was backed with troops from just four other countries: Australia, Denmark, Poland and the United Kingdom. Bush announced that the “ major military combat actions” in Iraq — officially dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom — ended on May 1, 2003. The Days Just Before and After Invasion In the hours before bombing began, Biden appeared on CNN and again warned that a large international group would be needed to successfully navigate, and help pay for, the rebuilding of Iraq once the fighting stopped. “And so that’s why I hope we begin a new round of diplomacy on, what [happens] after Saddam. Who is going to be in there with us?” Biden said. Biden was asked about comments made by fellow Democratic Sen. Tom Daschle two days prior that he was “[s] addened that we have to give up one life because this president couldn’t create the kind of diplomatic effort that was so critical for our country.” “There’s a lot of us who voted for giving the president the authority to take down Saddam Hussein if he didn’t disarm,” Biden said. “And there are those who believe, at the end of the day, even though it wasn’t handled all that well, we still have to take him down. But what you are sensing from some Democrats, as well as Republicans, is a frustration relating to the lost opportunities of maybe being able to do this with others, maybe, if we had others with us, not even having to go to war. So I don’t think it’s anything other than a frustration. “But I think it’s time we stop all that,” Biden said. “We have one single focus. And that is, we’re about to send our women and men to war. The president is the commander in chief. We voted to give him the authority to wage that war. We should step back and be supportive.” On April 2, 2003, Biden was again asked in a CNN interview about Daschle’s comments critical of Bush’s diplomatic efforts. This time, Biden said he “disagreed” with Daschle, who, like Biden, voted in favor of the authorization of force. “The way the Constitution works is, we voted to give the president the authority to go to war,” Biden said. “It’s our decision whether or not we go from a state of peace to a state of war. We gave him that authority. You can second guess whether we should have or not. Once we’ve [done] that then it’s his decision to prosecute the war. I wish he had been more successful and more earnest [in] his diplomacy. And my prayer now is … that he’ll be more successful in diplomacy of how to win the peace. But as the conduct of the war goes, that’s his call.” In an interview with Charlie Rose on March 20, 2003, the day after the start of the war, Rose asked about Biden’s comment that the war was the biggest roll of the dice by a president he had seen during his 30 years in the Senate. Biden said that comment referred to “the willingness to go without any real consensus in the world community.” Rose then asked if there was “a payoff at the end that justifies the risk” of war with Iraq. “I think there’s a payoff at the end and that is Saddam Hussein being separated from weapons of mass destruction and enforcing a U.N. commitment made by Saddam about those weapons,” Biden said. Later, Rose asked, “If in fact the war goes well, in however you define that … would you then say that George Bush made a wise decision in rolling the dice to disarm Saddam Hussein?” “I all along, Charlie, believed the right decision is to separate him from his weapons and/or separate him from power,” Biden said. “If the U.N. didn’t do it, do it?” Rose interjected. “Yes, you’ve gotta do it,” Biden said. “Now, it’s not the time to argue it, but I am disturbed at the lost opportunities we had to bring the rest of the world along with us to this point. … And now the question is … can you make lemonade out of lemons here? And I think we have an opportunity in the aftermath of this war to repair those kinds of breaches and end up where we should be anyway, which is having made the right decision to take him down, and having not fractured in any permanent way alliances and opportunities that we’re going to need available to us, Charlie, to deal with other major problems facing us in the world, from the Korean peninsula to South Asia, to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.” Biden continued to make similar comments in the months after the war started. For example, in a Brookings Institution address on July 31, 2003, Biden again defended his vote to authorize the use of military force in Iraq. The Bush administration was “ right to confront the challenge posed by Saddam thumbing his nose at the world and refusing — refusing — to alter his conduct,” Biden said . “ Contrary to what some in my party might think, Iraq was a problem that had to be dealt with sooner, rather than later. So I commend the president. He was right to enforce the solemn commitments made by Saddam. If they were not enforced … what good would they be and what value those institutions? For me, the issue was never whether we had to deal with Saddam, but when and how we dealt with Saddam. And it’s precisely the when and how that I think this administration got wrong. We went to war too soon. We went to war with too few troops. We went to war without the world, when we could have had many with us, and we’re paying the price for it now.” It wasn’t until Nov. 27, 2005, that Biden acknowledged on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that his 2002 vote authorizing force in Iraq was “a mistake.” “ It was a mistake,” Biden said. “It was a mistake to assume the president would use the authority we gave him properly. … We gave the president the authority to unite the world to isolate Saddam. And the fact of the matter is, we went too soon. We went without sufficient force. And we went without a plan .” Categories FactCheck Posts Featured Posts Tags 2020 Election Location International Issue authorizing force in Iraq Iraq war People Joe Biden Previous Story Buttigieg Wrong About Climate Change’s Effect on Oceans Next Story Meme Misleads on Walmart Gun Sales Ask FactCheck Q: Is it true the rumor that all Social Security beneficiaries will have to go to a location to verify their identity to receive their monthly check?

Biden said the US does not expect Serbia to recognise Kosovo's declaration of independence [AFP] Published On 20 May 2009 20 May 2009 Serbia ‘humiliated’ But nationalist parties urged the former US senator to leave the country, holding up signs with slogans such as “Biden, you Nazi scum, go home” during a parliamentary session. Nationalists accuse Biden of being the chief advocate of Nato’s bombing of Serbia in 1999 over the Kosovo conflict, and also resent his lobbying for Bosnian Muslims in their 1992-5 fight against Bosnian Serbs. They have opposed his visit, saying it amounts to a “humiliation” of the country. Washington’s backing for the unilateral declaration of independence last year by the province of Kosovo also angered the Balkan nation as well as Russia, its long-time ally. In a live televised broadcast from parliament, opposition Radical Party deputies, who occupy around a fifth of places in the assembly, appeared dressed in T-shirts bearing the image of Vojislav Seselj, the party’s president, who is currently on trial for war crimes before a UN tribunal in The Hague, the Netherlands. Protests banned Dragan Todorovic, Seselj’s acting leader, described Biden’s visit as “the saddest day in Serbia’s history”. Advertisement He said the US represented “all bad things that have struck the Serbian people, and whose inspirer was, for the large part, Biden”. Several hundred Radical Party supporters also staged a protest in a Belgrade suburb, despite a police ban on demonstrations against the US planned by nationalists during Biden’s visit. Soldiers and police have lined routes during Biden’s travels in Serbia, keeping the public away. During his visit, Biden attempted to quell disagreements over the status of Kosovo. ‘New communication’ He promised that Serbia’s refusal to recognise the province’s self-declared independence would not hinder its attempts to enter the European Union. While nationalists oppose his visit in Serbia, Kosovo looks to welcome Biden [AFP] “We do not expect Serbia any time soon to recognise Kosovo,” he said. “But we expect Belgrade to co-operate with the European Union and other key international actors on Kosovo and look for pragmatic solutions that will improve the lives of its people, Serb and Albanian.” Tadic said Kosovo’s declaration of independence violated international law, but said his country sought a partnership with Washington. “Notwithstanding our different positions on the Kosovo question, Serbia wishes for the best possible relations with the United States, as partners,” he said. He said he and Biden had “agreed that we now have an opportunity to establish a completely new level of communication between our two countries”. Bosnian visit Biden’s visit to Serbia is part of a three-day visit to the Balkans. During an address in Sarajevo, Bosnia’s capital, on Tuesday, he pledged to support attempts by the region’s nations to enter the EU and urged Bosnia’s leaders to heal ethnic rifts to prevent violence from erupting in the country again. Advertisement He said: “Today, to be very blunt with you, I personally, and the leadership of my country, is worried … about the direction of your country and your future.” Bosnia has been plagued by ethnic divisions since the US-brokered Dayton peace accords ended the country’s civil war in 1995. Biden concludes his Balkan trip with a visit to Kosovo on Thursday.

His message came in a congratulatory note to Mohamed al-Mnifi, Chairman of Libya’s Presidential Council, marking the nation’s 73rd Independence Anniversary, celebrated annually on 24 December. According to the Presidential Council’s media office, Biden emphasised the United States’ dedication to aiding Libyan partners in strengthening political, economic, and security ties. He highlighted the importance of fostering deep collaborations across Libya to ensure long-term stability and prosperity. In addition to Biden’s message, al-Mnifi received congratulatory notes from Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and Chad’s President Mahamat Idriss Déby. Déby’s letter expressed warm wishes on behalf of the Chadian people and government. “On the occasion of Libya’s national holiday, I extend my heartfelt congratulations and best wishes for health, peace, and prosperity,” he wrote. These messages reflect growing international interest in Libya’s political stability and development, particularly as the nation continues to navigate its path toward unity and governance amid ongoing challenges. Libya’s Independence Day serves as a reminder of the country’s hard-fought liberation in 1951, achieved through the efforts of its founders. Global leaders, through such gestures, aim to emphasise their support for Libya’s sovereignty and progress, encouraging collective efforts to overcome its current challenges.

The claim that President Buhari has signed a new police bill which allows the police to arrest without a warrant or court order is true. The bill is confirmed to have been in place since September 16, 2020. Full Text On August 24, a verified twitter handle, Wanazila (@wana_) claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari has signed a new police bill that gives the Police the right to arrest without a warrant or court order. Culled from twitter.com Following the claim on the ‘new provision’ in the New Police Act, controversies have been stirred up in the comment section. Some persons have tagged the claim as fake news. For instance, Thelomen Tarteno with the user name @narpako, wrote, ‘Jumping to conclusions, sensationalism, peddling misinformation and all-out spreading of bullshit is the universal talent shared by a great many Nigerians’. Tammy Solo Qtified (@tmscool) wrote, ‘You are one of the reasons we can’t move forward. You thrive in peddling false info or uninformed info just to feel relevant right?’ Some other people believe the law has been existing before now and see no reason why it should be newsworthy. For instance, A twitter user Abiola De Moe (@abiolamoe) wrote, ‘This isn’t a new law. A police officer can affect arrest in an on-going crime or that which is about to happen without a warrant. Stop trying to add this to one of the regular ‘troll-the government threads…’ another user named Dami (@TheAngleDami) said ‘‘Buhari didn’t just sign this… This law has always been there…’. This tweet garnered a whopping 2.6k retweets, 734 quoted tweets and 1.6k likes. With diverse opinions that ranged from disbelief, doubt to believability. Verification Information about the signing of the b ill was shared by credible news sources , on September 16, 2020, when President Muhammadu Buhari assented to a new Nigeria Police Bill, 2020. The new act which has 142 sections explains the general duties of the Police to include, among others, protection of the rights and freedom of every person in Nigeria, the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights and any other law; provision on humanitarian assistance for citizens, facilitation of movement on highways, etc without subjecting citizens to extortion, and adoption of community partnership in the performance of police duties. The power to arrest without a warrant was spelt out in Section 38(1) of the act. “(1) In addition to the powers of arrest without warrant conferred upon a police officer by section 10 of the Criminal Procedure Act, it shall be lawful for any police officer and any person whom he may call to his assistance, to arrest without warrant in the following cases- [Cap. C41.] (a) any person whom he finds committing any felony, misdemeanour or simple offence, or whom he reasonably suspects of having committed or of being about to commit any felony, misdemeanour or breach of the peace; (b) any person whom any other person charged with having committed a felony or misdemeanour; (c) any person whom any other person- (i) suspects of having committed a felony or misdemeanour; or (ii) charges with having committed a simple offence, if such other person is willing to accompany the police officer to the police station and to enter into a recognisance to prosecute such charge.” In summary, the bill states that a police officer has the power to arrest whom he suspects (on a reasonable ground) of having committed an offence unless the law creating the offence provides that the suspect cannot be arrested without a warrant. “(2) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any offence with respect to which it is provided that any offender may not be arrested without warrant.” Further research shows that the repealed Police Cap P19 LFN 2004 Act also has provision for the ‘no warrant arrest’ in section 24(1) of the repealed Act. It states It states, “ A police officer may, without an order of a court and without a warrant arrest a suspect: Whom he suspects on reasonable grounds of having committed an offence against a law in Nigeria or against the law of any other country unless these creating the offence provides that the suspect cannot be arrested without warrant.” CONCLUSION The viral tweet on the New Police Act by the Twitter user is TRUE . President Muhammadu Buhari assented to a new Nigeria Police Bill, 2020 which accords police officers the power to arrest without a warrant except on grounds where the laws spelling out an offence permit a warrant before an arrest.

CBO’s analysis contradicts President Biden’s false claim that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) led to less revenue from corporations. This amount exceeds CBO’s own forecasts prior to enactment of TCJA and debunks Democrats’ main excuse to raise taxes on American businesses. Even the Biden Administration predicts that under Republicans’ tax reform law, corporate tax revenues will climb in 2025 to an even higher amount than the Trump administration predicted in 2017. As the Tax Foundation points out , “[I]t seems clear that the 2017 tax reform did not substantially reduce the revenue potential of the corporate tax.” KEY POINTS: Corporate tax revenue is shattering records under Republican tax reform. Corporate tax revenue is coming in 22 percent higher than last year’s record level, according to the CBO’s most recent monthly budget review . Corporate tax revenue is set to hit a new record of $454 billion. CBO had predicted in June 2017 that corporate tax revenue would only hit $389 billion in 2022. As a share of GDP, corporate tax revenue is on track to reach its highest level since 2015 (1.9 percent of GDP). Overall tax revenue is also strong, including individual, payroll, and other taxes. Individual income tax receipts reached an all-time high of $2.04 trillion in FY2021. Receipts are already coming in 36 percent higher in FY2022. Total federal tax collections, including payroll and other taxes, are on track to reach $5.04 trillion in FY22, or 21.0 percent of GDP. This would be a new all-time high in both cases. Democrats ignore this progress in favor of raising taxes even higher on Americans, including in President Biden’s most recent budget request. Democrats seek the highest sustained tax burden in American history. House Budget Committee Republicans’ analysis shows $58 trillion in tax hikes (an 80 percent increase over previous 10 years) that breaks President Biden’s tax pledge by hitting the middle class and small family businesses, and does even more socialist spending. READ: House Budget Committee Analysis, “Biden’s FY23 Budget: Another Year of Crisis” (PDF) Democrats’ tax plan makes inflation worse when it is already 276 percent higher than predicted by Biden’s budget last year because of higher spending . But higher taxes will also result in higher prices for consumers. American families paid a $5,000 inflation tax in 2021 and view Washington spending as a big part of the problem. Biden’s international tax increases make it better to be a foreign company or worker. American companies will pay a global minimum tax rate higher than the 15 percent rate the Biden Administration will allow for other countries. This economic surrender will make Americans less competitive and will drive manufacturing, research, and investment overseas. Worse, America will be less competitive with a higher tax rate than Communist China , sending jobs fleeing overseas. Democrats’ revive their supercharged death tax that targets family-owned businesses and farms, costing at least 1 million jobs. Analysis by the Family Business Estate Tax Coalition, Democrats’ death tax will destroy over a million jobs, slash paychecks for workers by $32 for every $100 in revenue raised, and shrink our economy by $100 billion over the next decade.

Former President Donald Trump is proposing to lower the federal corporate tax rate to 15%, insisting that when he lowered it to 21% starting in 2018, revenues received by the government actually went up due to economic growth it spurred. Economists say that’s not what happened. They say that while cutting the rate from 35% to 21% did stimulate some growth, it did not cover the loss in tax revenue. Vice President Kamala Harris, meanwhile, claimed “the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.” That’s a subjective characterization, but most economists agree the tax cuts did add to the nation’s rising debt. When the Trump-championed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act went into effect in 2018, economists saw an opportunity to test the theory that tax cuts pay for themselves due to economic growth. Six years later, Trump says the results are in and that the U.S. took in more revenue after corporate tax cuts in the TCJA. Revenues actually went down in the first two years after the TCJA was enacted, and then the pandemic hit — which muddied analyses of the TCJA’s impact. Revenues went up after 2020, though economists say revenues are not up as much as was expected in the absence of the TCJA when taking inflation into account. And the government’s nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the tax law is contributing to rising national debt, and would add hundreds of billions to the nation’s debt if all the individual income tax provisions set to expire at the end of 2025 are extended. Trump’s Take Back in September 2017 before Congress had even taken up his promised tax changes, Trump promised , “It will be revenue-neutral when you add growth because we’re going to have magnificent growth.” The government’s nonpartisan budget experts, however, were less optimistic. Late that year, Trump signed the tax legislation into law. In 2018, the CBO estimated that on a conventional basis, the law would increase deficits by about $1.8 trillion over 10 years (or by about $2.25 trillion including interest on the additional debt). Expected economic growth from the tax cuts would offset some of that, CBO said, but even with that growth, the law would increase deficits by about $1.3 trillion (or by $1.9 trillion including interest on the additional debt). Nonetheless, in August 2018, Trump’s treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, insisted that due to a stimulation of growth “this tax plan will not only pay for itself but in fact create additional revenue for the government.” As we wrote in early 2019, that wasn’t true in the first year. Overall revenues went down in the first year of the tax cuts — and in 2019 and 2020 overall. In 2020, though, after the start of the pandemic, revenues began to steadily rise. At a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Oct. 5, Trump talked about reducing the corporate tax rate even lower, from 21% in the TCJA to 15% (provided companies agree to make their products in the U.S.).

I got it done, and we had the best boom we’ve ever had. We did more revenue when we had it at 21 than when it was at 39. Think of it. Much more.” Trump wrongly said, “The following year we did much more.” A point of clarification: While Trump often says he cut the corporate tax rate from 39% to 21%, the federal statutory corporate tax rate was actually 35% prior to the implementation of the TCJA, which lowered the rate to 21%. Kyle Pomerleau , a senior fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said Trump appears to be including the federal tax plus the average of state and local taxes to get to 39%. But if those are included, then the current rate is roughly 25.8%, not 21%. Revenues Post-TCJA It is technically true that corporate revenues rose a few years after the passage of the TCJA, as is clear from a graph of government revenue from taxes on corporate income provided by the Federal Reserve . As the data show, corporate tax revenues dropped in 2018, the first year of the TCJA, and were lower still by the first quarter of 2020. The question is whether the subsequent rise through the second quarter of this year was due to the TCJA, and whether revenues would have risen even more had the TCJA tax cuts not been enacted. “This seemingly simple question is amazingly hard to answer,” Jeffrey Hoopes , a professor at the University of North Carolina business school and research director of the UNC Tax Center, told us via email. The steady rise in revenues didn’t begin until the third quarter of 2020 — which coincides with the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. “The problem, of course, is that more than the TCJA happened,” Hoopes said. “Congress dumped trillions of dollars into the economy in so-called COVID recovery, and that really helped corporate profits, and therefore, corporate tax revenue for the US Treasury. The question is not whether we did better or worse afterwards, but rather, how much the TCJA actually cost us. And, the answer is it likely cost us a lot. In other words, that sharply pointing up graph would have been even steeper. Some estimates are that the TCJA decreased corporate tax revenue by something like 40%.” For that last figure, Hoopes is referring to research by Gabriel Chodorow-Reich, Owen Zidar and Eric Zwick that was published in the Journal of Economic Perspectives in the summer of 2024. That report concluded, “First, and most obvious, large corporate tax cuts are expensive and increase the deficit substantially; specifically, the reform reduced corporate tax revenue by 40 percent of the pre-reform level.” “But, those are econometric estimates,” Hoopes said. “We can’t know for sure.” Marc Goldwein , senior vice president and senior policy director of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group that seeks lower deficits, says the evidence is clear: “The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced revenue. It’s irrefutable. … It definitely increased the deficits.” “Immediately after the tax cuts were passed, the next year revenues fell,” Goldwein told us in a phone interview, and that was true in real dollars as well as relative to gross domestic product. In 2021 and 2022, revenues were significantly higher than CBO projected when it projected the TCJA would increase deficits by more than $500 billion for those two years, but by 2023, revenues had returned to the CBO’s projected level. “Overall the TCJA cost more than we initially projected it would, not less,” Goldwein said. While there has been some economic growth from the tax cuts, he said, there is “no evidence” the law “paid for itself,” as some predicted it would. As part of its regular polling of economic experts in the U.S., the Clark Center for Global Markets at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business in November 2023 asked the panel whether they agreed that “[f]ederal tax revenues are substantially lower now as a result of the passage of the TCJA than they would have been had the TCJA not been passed, and all else was equal.” Of the 29 experts who answered, 24 said they either agreed or strongly agreed (83%). Four said they were uncertain, and only one expert disagreed. In research published in the Journal of Economic Perspectives in the summer of 2024, William Gale , co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, Hoopes and Pomerleau found that total federal tax revenues in the first two years of the TCJA — 2018 and 2019 — were about $545 billion, or 7.4%, below what was projected by the CBO before the bill was passed, including 37% below CBO’s projection for corporate tax revenue. “Based on evidence through 2019, we find that the TCJA clearly raised federal debt and increased after-tax incomes, disproportionately increasing incomes for the most affluent,” they wrote. After 2019, the picture becomes much more cloudy. “It is hard to discern effects after 2019 because of COVID,” Gale told us via email. As Gale and his colleagues explained in their paper, “[T]he disruption created by COVID and subsequent fiscal and monetary actions, as well as the large corporate tax cut passed by Democrats in 2022 by way of the Inflation Reduction Act, blur the impact of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act.” The Inflation Reduction Act’s 15% corporate minimum tax was projected to raise corporate tax revenue, but reduce corporate taxes overall through the expansion of green energy subsidies. “[T]here is no evidence to back up Trump’s claim,” Pomerleau, of the American Enterprise Institute, told us via email. “The TCJA reduced both individual and corporate income tax revenue. If you look at CBO’s estimates of how much the TCJA would reduce federal revenues back in early 2018, they were about right in line with what they ended up being after the fact. For example, the [CBO] projected federal revenue to be roughly $3.49 trillion in 2019 after the TCJA, which was projected to reduce revenue in that year by $285 billion. According to CBO, the federal government actually collected $3.46 trillion. “It is true the CBO projections are subject to revision when better economic data becomes available,” Pomerleau said. “However, even if you go back to CBO’s 2017 projection—made before passage of the TCJA—they estimated revenue was going to be $3.68 trillion. So a revenue loss no matter how you look at it. “After 2019, the story is much more complicated,” Pomerleau said. “The COVID pandemic destroyed any clean baseline we could look at. In addition, Congress passed significant policies in the interim that impacted economic output, federal spending, and federal revenues. Furthermore, monetary policy was very accommodative, leading to inflation which also distorts revenue collections. There is simply no sound way to attribute any changes to revenues over the last 4 years to the TCJA.” Despite the revenue losses, Pomerleau said the TCJA corporate tax cut “did have benefits,” citing “additional productive investment” and “reducing incentives for corporations to shift profits overseas.” In April, National Bureau of Economic Research-affiliated researchers wrote about the TCJA’s corporate investment incentives. A summary of their paper said that “the increased investment and wages resulting from the law have very limited effects on receipts from the corporate income tax or other revenue sources, such as the payroll tax and income tax. They conclude that such indirect effects do not substantially offset the decline in domestic corporate tax revenue of about 40 percent over the 10-year budget window.” Presenting an opposing view, Douglas Holtz-Eakin , president of the conservative-leaning American Action Forum and a former CBO director, wrote in April that while there was “a sharp falloff of revenue in 2018, immediately after the rate cut … revenue in 2022 and 2023 is above the amount projected by CBO even though the rate is lower. The latter fact indicates that one does not need the 35 percent rate to generate the revenues that were raised in 2017. In this sense, one might argue the rate cut paid for itself. Yet it is fair to note that revenues were below the projection from 2018 to 2021 – in part because of the arrival of the pandemic in 2020 – and the cumulative shortfall from 2018 to 2023 is $353 billion. In this sense, the cut did not pay for itself.” However, he argues, the tax changes were still worth it because “the gains from removing tax-base distortions to location, investment, and finance decisions in the corporate sector are sufficient to offset the near-term revenue loss.” Accounting for Inflation The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget counters that once corporate tax revenue is adjusted for the recent surge in inflation it is “almost identical to where CBO projected it would be after the TCJA was enacted.” In other words, on pace to be more than $1 trillion lower over 10 years. Daniel Bunn , president and CEO of the Tax Foundation, told us via email that without accounting for inflation, revenues are higher than expected. “How much of that is caused by TCJA? That’s really unclear, and we may never have a full accounting of that because the trade war, pandemic, inflation, etc. all contributed to the trend,” Bunn said. “There were also significant capital gains realizations that were partially driven by a strong market and perhaps some investors who were concerned that the capital gains rate would go up during the Biden administration. The jury is out on how much [of the revenue increase] TCJA caused.” Bunn also looked at revenue adjusted for inflation, and he said it “shows revenues are below what was projected [by CBO] in 2017.” “We are raising record amounts of revenue, but you can’t associate all of that with the TCJA,” Bunn said. “Given that the inflation adjustment shows we’re raising less than projected in 2017, the tax cut did increase the deficit by reducing revenues. Even if spending had remained constant (which it didn’t) the tax reforms would have increased the deficit. But, it’s also true that revenues are outperforming [CBO’s] initial estimates of their impact, so the deficit impact is smaller than it would have been otherwise.” Goldwein said it makes sense to adjust revenues for inflation. “The nominal revenues were higher because the price of everything was higher,” he said. Did TCJA ‘Blow Up’ Deficits? As for Harris, she has claimed Trump’s tax cuts “blew up” the federal budget and has called for increasing the statutory federal corporate tax rate to 28% to raise revenues. “There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit,” she said in a “60 Minutes” interview. But that’s a subjective characterization. “The TCJA certainly cost a lot of money,” Hoopes told us. “But much less than several things we have done since.” “To ‘blow up’ a deficit, I would expect to see a change in slope starting at 2018,” Hoopes said. “You don’t really see it so much. But it clearly was not a cheap tax cut. Some estimates would put it in the ballpark of what the IRA in 2022 cost. It certainly cost a lot!” With many of the tax cuts scheduled to expire at the end of 2025, CRFB warns: “Extending these expiring tax cuts could lose $3.4 trillion over the subsequent decade, or more than $4 trillion if corporate provisions are revived as well.” The Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates that permanently extending all the tax cuts in the TCJA would increase deficits by $3.83 trillion over 10 years when factoring in the economic benefits. As we said, Trump has proposed cutting the corporate tax rate even lower, to 15%. Depending on how Trump would structure the lower corporate tax rate, CRFB estimates it would reduce federal revenues anywhere from $200 billion to $675 billion over 10 years. PWBM estimates it would reduce revenues by $595 billion over 10 years. Harris proposes to increase the statutory federal corporate tax rate to 28%. CRFB’s midpoint estimate is that that would raise about $900 billion over 10 years. Nonetheless, CRFB estimates that the full economic plans proposed by Harris and Trump would, on net, add to the country’s debt — Harris’ by $3.5 trillion and Trump’s by $7.5 trillion. The debt held by the public is currently over $28 trillion . It increased by about $7.2 trillion under Trump, and has risen by $6.7 trillion so far under Biden.

And despite its struggles with staying on schedule and the unusual way its presidential nominee was chosen, this year’s Democratic gathering in Chicago has been no different. The Democrats on the convention stage have tried to put their best foot forward by talking about Kamala Harris’s qualifications and character, her plan for the economy and issues on which the party has broad public support, like abortion rights and healthcare. But what they don’t talk about – the issues and areas they have largely tried to avoid, at least so far – says as much about their electoral strategies and weakness as what they choose to highlight. Here are three notable omissions halfway through the party extravaganza. Analysing the Harris and Trump 2024 campaign ads Identity politics Four years ago, amidst the mass protests over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police officers, the Democratic Party – and the nation as a whole – engaged in a sometimes animated debate about institutional racism and how American history is presented. While many mainstream Democrats avoided the aggressive calls to “defund the police”, most engaged in the discussion of how America could take steps to address what they viewed as the corrosive legacy of slavery in the nation’s businesses, classrooms and government, including by promoting DEI - diversity, equity and inclusion More recently, the issue of transgender rights has been an animating force among segments of the Democratic coalition – particularly in the face of Republican efforts to limit or prohibit the ability of children to receive gender care. Follow live updates on this story 'Coach Walz' rallies Democrats with personal pitch to middle America Oprah Winfrey tells voters to 'choose truth' in surprise convention speech Democrats try to turn tables on one of their biggest weaknesses What young Democrats want Harris to do if she wins Neither topic has received much attention in the Democratic convention arena so far. There was an emotional tribute to the civil rights movement early on Monday that culminated in a wheelchair-bound Jesse Jackson – who marched with Martin Luther King Jr and ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 1980s – taking the stage. But DEI and other remedies have received short shrift. “DEI has become a dog-whistle code” used to undermine minorities in powerful positions, said Shavon Arline-Bradley, the president of the National Council of Negro Women, which is organising voter outreach efforts in presidential battleground states. “Our country was founded on opportunities for all men and all women, but we're not hearing that now, because a lot of people don't want to alienate a certain base of folk that are afraid of this.” At this convention, alienating the fewest number of potential voters has been the name of the game. And while abortion rights have been a daily focus at the convention, transgender issues – the other hot-button social topic currently - have been largely ignored in the programming that makes national television. Ms Arline-Bradley warns that by not talking about questions of equity and inclusion, the problems will linger. “We should talk about them, because this party is the most inclusive and diverse party,” she said. “Show it, activate it and live by those values.” Getty Images Some hot-button social topics have been largely ignored in the programming that makes national television Internal strife The last Democratic convention in 2020 was largely virtual – conducted in empty halls and television studios - due to the Covid pandemic. In 2016, when thousands of Democrats gathered in Philadelphia, the rifts within the party were on full display. Supporters of Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders, who finished second behind Hillary Clinton for that year’s nomination, repeatedly disrupted the proceedings and organised protests around the convention hall. The party was divided on topics like universal healthcare, free college tuition and, more broadly, whether Democrats should rely on support from deep-pocketed donors, big business and what Mr Sanders labelled the “corporate oligarchy”. Those divisions still exist. Mr Sanders gave a speech Tuesday night railing against the corrupting influence of money in politics. But his speech was immediately followed by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who bragged about being a billionaire, and venture capitalist and former American Express chief executive Ken Chenault. The big tent, at least for now, covered obvious differences of policy and opinion. Barack and Michelle Obama electrify Democrats Day three of Democratic Convention features party's rising stars What young Democrats want Harris to do if she wins Another current area of sharp divide within the party is US military support for Israel amidst the ongoing war in Gaza. Thousands of protesters have demonstrated outside the convention’s security perimeter, but the intense disagreements have received little attention inside the convention hall. Mr Sanders received applause when he called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, and Joe Biden turned some heads when he said in his speech on Monday that protesters “have a point” when they say there have been too many civilian deaths. But all this is a far cry from 2016, when some antiwar convention attendees booed former four-star General John Allen and former Secretary of Defence and CIA Director Leon Panetta during their speeches. Immigration Ever since undocumented crossings at the US-Mexico border surged early in the Biden presidency, the subject of immigration has been a liability for Democrats. Republicans have blamed the administration’s policies for encouraging the historic rise in border incursions, and the flood of new arrivals – many of whom have been transported by conservative governors to populous Democratic cities – has strained public services. The Harris campaign appears to recognise her vulnerability on the issue. One of its first television adverts blamed Donald Trump for sinking bipartisan border-security legislation earlier this year and touted Ms Harris’s record prosecuting “transnational gangs, the drug cartels and the human traffickers” while she was California’s attorney general. But immigration appears to be an issue the Harris team would rather talk about in 50-second television adverts than from the stage in Chicago. The topic has got a few lines here and there, but compared to the 2020 convention – when Donald Trump’s hard line on immigration was a primary focus of attack – the silence has been conspicuous. Reports suggest this could change on Wednesday night, with some speakers due to address the issue. Watch now on iPlayer (UK only) Who Is Kamala Harris?

National Legal Issues Wisconsin Chris Larson Police clear a park during clashes with protesters outside the Kenosha County Courthouse late Tuesday, Aug. 25, 2020, in Kenosha, Wis., during demonstrations over the Sunday shooting of Jacob Blake. (AP) By Madeline Heim August 27, 2020 Yes, police were 20.8 more likely to kill than be killed by a criminal in 2019 If Your Time is short Statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigation show that 89 U.S. law enforcement officials were killed on the job in 2019, 48 of them stemming from criminal acts. Also in 2019, police killed 999 Americans, according to a database from the Washington Post. Black Americans were more than twice as likely to be shot and killed by police than their white counterparts If 48 police officers were killed, and 999 deaths occured at the hands of police, that puts Larson’s claim on track. See the sources for this fact-check Widespread condemnation of police brutality has picked up once again after Kenosha police shot Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, seven times at close range as he attempted to get into his SUV late in the afternoon of Aug. 23, 2020. As Blake remained at a Milwaukee hospital, where his family’s attorneys say he is paralyzed from the waist down , protests developed in Kenosha and across the state. Politicians from both sides of the aisle have weighed in, including state Sen. Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, who wrote this in an Aug. 24, 2020, Facebook post : "In 2019, 89 officers died in the line of duty. While every death is tragic, almost half (41) were accidental. That same year, officers shot and killed 999 people. Police are 20.8 times more likely to kill than be killed by a criminal. We must drastically reduce the use of deadly force in this country." Is he correct that in 2019, police were "20.8 times more likely to kill than be killed by a criminal." Sign up for PolitiFact texts Is he correct? This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. ( Read more about our partnership with Facebook ). Let’s break down the numbers. Police officer deaths vs. deaths caused by police, by the numbers To back up his claim, Larson’s office cited statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the number of law enforcement officers who died in the line of duty during 2019. According to those statistics, 89 officers were killed in such incidents last year. Forty-one of those officers were killed accidentally, the FBI says, most often in car accidents. That leaves 48 of what the FBI calls "felonious" deaths, which are deaths caused by criminal acts. Turning to the number of people killed by police last year, Larson’s office pointed to the Washington Post’s "Fatal Force" database , which since 2015 has been logging fatal shootings by on-duty police officers throughout the U.S. The Post tracks such cases by following local news, law enforcement websites and social media, submitting open records requests and verifying incidents with the police department in question. Featured Fact-check Donald Trump stated on March 17, 2025 in a Truth Social post Former President Joe Biden’s pardons of lawmakers on the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack “are hereby declared void, vacant, and of no further force or effect,” because “they were done by autopen.” By Louis Jacobson • March 17, 2025 In 2019, 999 people were shot and killed by police, according to the database . In his Facebook post, Larson does the math: If criminal acts led to 48 officer deaths in 2019, and officers killed 999 people in the same year, that would make police approximately 20.8 times more likely to kill someone than be killed in a criminal act. The Post database breaks down another important data point: Black Americans are more likely to be shot and killed by police than white Americans.

National Legal Issues Wisconsin Chris Larson Police clear a park during clashes with protesters outside the Kenosha County Courthouse late Tuesday, Aug. 25, 2020, in Kenosha, Wis., during demonstrations over the Sunday shooting of Jacob Blake. (AP) By Madeline Heim August 27, 2020 Yes, police were 20.8 more likely to kill than be killed by a criminal in 2019 If Your Time is short Statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigation show that 89 U.S. law enforcement officials were killed on the job in 2019, 48 of them stemming from criminal acts. Also in 2019, police killed 999 Americans, according to a database from the Washington Post. Black Americans were more than twice as likely to be shot and killed by police than their white counterparts If 48 police officers were killed, and 999 deaths occured at the hands of police, that puts Larson’s claim on track. See the sources for this fact-check Widespread condemnation of police brutality has picked up once again after Kenosha police shot Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man, seven times at close range as he attempted to get into his SUV late in the afternoon of Aug. 23, 2020. As Blake remained at a Milwaukee hospital, where his family’s attorneys say he is paralyzed from the waist down , protests developed in Kenosha and across the state. Politicians from both sides of the aisle have weighed in, including state Sen. Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, who wrote this in an Aug. 24, 2020, Facebook post : "In 2019, 89 officers died in the line of duty. While every death is tragic, almost half (41) were accidental. That same year, officers shot and killed 999 people. Police are 20.8 times more likely to kill than be killed by a criminal. We must drastically reduce the use of deadly force in this country." Is he correct that in 2019, police were "20.8 times more likely to kill than be killed by a criminal." Sign up for PolitiFact texts Is he correct? This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. ( Read more about our partnership with Facebook ). Let’s break down the numbers. Police officer deaths vs. deaths caused by police, by the numbers To back up his claim, Larson’s office cited statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the number of law enforcement officers who died in the line of duty during 2019. According to those statistics, 89 officers were killed in such incidents last year. Forty-one of those officers were killed accidentally, the FBI says, most often in car accidents. That leaves 48 of what the FBI calls "felonious" deaths, which are deaths caused by criminal acts. Turning to the number of people killed by police last year, Larson’s office pointed to the Washington Post’s "Fatal Force" database , which since 2015 has been logging fatal shootings by on-duty police officers throughout the U.S. The Post tracks such cases by following local news, law enforcement websites and social media, submitting open records requests and verifying incidents with the police department in question. Featured Fact-check Donald Trump stated on March 17, 2025 in a Truth Social post Former President Joe Biden’s pardons of lawmakers on the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack “are hereby declared void, vacant, and of no further force or effect,” because “they were done by autopen.” By Louis Jacobson • March 17, 2025 In 2019, 999 people were shot and killed by police, according to the database . In his Facebook post, Larson does the math: If criminal acts led to 48 officer deaths in 2019, and officers killed 999 people in the same year, that would make police approximately 20.8 times more likely to kill someone than be killed in a criminal act. The Post database breaks down another important data point: Black Americans are more likely to be shot and killed by police than white Americans. Black people account for less than 13% of the U.S. population but are killed by police at more than double the rate of white people Black people are killed by police at a rate of 32 deaths per million people, Hispanic people at a rate of 24 per million, and white people at a rate of 13 per million, according to the database.

Image by Mick Tsikas/AAP PHOTOS AAP FactCheck Investigation: Did a greater proportion of 16 year olds vote in elections in Scotland, Wales and Austria than 18 and 20 year olds? The Statement "We've seen that with other countries like Scotland and Wales and Austria, where they actually have a greater turnout of 16 year olds voting, instead of, more than 18 and 20 year olds." Make It 16 representative Sophie Crozier, August 24, 2020. The Analysis A group advocating for New Zealand's voting age to be lowered to 16 claims the move could boost voter turnout among young people. The group Make It 16 has taken its case to the NZ High Court, claiming the current voting age of 18 is discriminatory and inconsistent with the Bill of Rights. When Make It 16 representative Sophie Crozier appeared on The Project on Three on August 24, she said changing the voting age would have a positive impact on youth voter turnout. (Video mark 22min 57secs). "And we've seen that with other countries like Scotland and Wales and Austria, where they actually have a greater turnout of 16-year-olds voting, instead of, more than 18- and 20-year-olds and I think that's because you're in your own safety bubble," Ms Crozier said. AAP FactCheck examined Ms Crozier's statement that voter turnout was higher among 16-year-olds compared with 18- and 20-year-olds in elections in Scotland, Wales and Austria. In 2007, Austria became the first country in the European Union to lower the voting age to 16 for all national elections. In the 2020 book, Lowering the Voting Age to 16: Learning from Real Experiences Worldwide , University of Vienna researcher Julian Aichholzer reviews the research on the policy change in a chapter titled Voting at 16 in Practice: A Review of the Austrian Case . In total, three studies found turnout for 16- and 17-year-olds was generally higher than that for 18- to 20-year-olds in Austrian elections (page 4). One of those studies, titled Are People More Inclined to Vote at 16 than at 18? Evidence for the First-Time Voting Boost Among 16- to 25-Year-Olds in Austria , looked at two regional elections in Austria and found turnout was higher among 16-year-olds than 18-year-olds in Vienna. However, in the region of Krems, turnout among 16-year-olds was slightly lower than that for 18-year-olds (Figure 1 and figure 2, page 357). In both regions, 16-year-olds had a significantly higher turnout than 20-year-olds and the 16-17 age bracket had a higher turnout than the 18-20 age bracket (Table 2, page 358). In both cases, 16-year-olds also had a slightly lower turnout than the electorate as a whole (Figure 1 and figure 2, page 357). Aichholzer's report also included novel research, analysing data from five elections between 2005 and 2015 (page 6). It found 16-year-olds were estimated to have a higher turnout than 18-year-olds in all but one election, and higher than 20-year-olds in all elections. ( Figure 1, page 8 ). The report concluded the level of turnout was "generally higher among 16- to 17-year-olds (compared to 18- to 20-year-olds) and similar to the electorate's average (and here in particular amongst the 16-year-olds), as evidenced by official records from electoral lists." (page 16) The UK's All-Party Parliamentary Group on Votes at 16, which was set up to investigate lowering the voting age, published a report in 2019 which found turnout among 16- and 17-year-olds in Austria has stabilised at around 8-10 percentage points higher than 18- to 24-year-olds (page 15). Scotland first lowered the voting age to 16 for the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, and in 2015 it lowered the voting age for the Scottish parliamentary elections and local government elections . A UK Electoral Commission report on the referendum found the turnout of 16- and 17-year-olds was significantly higher than for 18-24 year olds. In total, 75 per cent of 16- and 17-year-olds claimed to have voted, compared with 54 per cent of those aged 18 to 24 years (page 64). This was based on a post-election survey of 1852 eligible voters and not the poll result itself (page 150). In total, 109,593 16- and 17-year-olds registered (page 1), which is an estimated 90 per cent of those eligible to vote based on figures from the National Records of Scotland , which show there were 121,657 16- and 17-year-olds in 2014. The Electoral Commission reports on the 2016 Scottish parliamentary elections and the 2017 local government elections did not include a breakdown of voter turnout in the 16-17 age group. However, raw data from a 2017 survey produced for the commission after the local government elections shows 51 per cent of 16- and 17- year-olds claim to have voted, compared with 39 per cent of those aged 18 to 24 (page 12). AAP FactCheck was unable to find figures for voter turnout among 16- and 17-year-olds in these elections. In Wales, 16-year-olds have not yet had the opportunity to vote. In November 2019, the Senedd Cymru/Welsh parliament voted to lower the voting age to 16 for the 2021 Senedd elections. Research in Austria and Scotland found more 16 and 17 year olds voted compared with 18-24 year olds. The Verdict AAP FactCheck found the statement that voter turnout was higher among 16-year-olds compared with 18- and 20-year-olds in elections in Scotland, Wales and Austria to be somewhat true. Research in Austria and Scotland found more 16- and 17-year-olds voted compared with 18- to 24-year-olds. However, Wales has only recently lowered the voting age for the Welsh parliamentary elections and 16-year-olds will not get the opportunity to vote until next year. Somewhat True - A part or parts of the claim are accurate but there is also a significant problem or inaccuracy. * AAP FactCheck is accredited by the Poynter Institute's International Fact-Checking Network, which promotes best practice through a stringent and transparent Code of Principles. https://aap.com.au/ Sources Fact-checking is a team effort Every AAP FactCheck article is the result of a meticulous process involving numerous experienced journalists and producers.

In the 2021 Holyrood elections, people under 30 who had been able to vote from age 16 went to the ballots in greater numbers than those enfranchised from age 18, the report found. Those who were able to vote as a 16 or 17 year-old were also more likely to continue voting into their 20s, researchers said. Studying voting habits from 2021 Scottish Parliamentary elections. A team from the universities of Edinburgh and Sheffield used voting habits from the 2021 Scottish Parliamentary elections to assess for the first time the long-term impact of Scotland lowering the voting age to 16 in 2014. The change was introduced for the 2014 independence referendum and then extended to Scottish local and parliamentary elections in 2015. Overall, researchers say the move has had positive long-term consequences for turnout. The boost was unrelated to whether people cast their first vote as a 16 or 17 year old in the independence referendum or in later elections. However, they found lowering the voting age had no longer-term effects on non-electoral forms of political engagement – such as involvement in demonstrations and petitions – or on addressing socio-economic inequalities in political engagement. When voting aged 16 or 17, the study found that socio-economic turnout inequalities were reduced and engagement in non-electoral politics was boosted, but these trends were not maintained as voters got older. Standard patterns of inequality re-emerged as people moved into their 20s, with those from higher socio-occupational classes more likely to vote. A lasting impact was found, however, for good civic education. Those who had taken classes in school where political issues had been discussed voted in greater numbers even as they grew older. Researchers surveyed 904 people aged 16 to 31 about their voting habits after the 2021 Scottish Parliament elections. They compared results from young people who could vote at 16 in the referendum on Scottish independence in 2014 and Scottish Parliament elections in 2016 or 2021 to young people whose first vote was at 18 in general, local or Scottish Parliament elections since 2010. A case for enfranchising younger voters across the UK Dr Jan Eichhorn, of the University of Edinburgh’s School of Social and Political Science, lead author of the study said: “Allowing 16- and 17-year olds to vote was a good decision taken by the Scottish Parliament. Many younger first-time voters retain a habit of voting and participate in greater numbers than older first-time voters. The findings strengthen the case for enfranchising younger voters across the UK to improve long term voting behaviour. But more can be done. Making sure all young people receive great civic education that includes learning how to discuss political issues well, could help reduce persistent social inequalities in turnout.” Dr Christine Hübner, of the University of Sheffield’s Sheffield Methods Institute, said: “The data allows us for the first time to look into the long-term trends in voting in Scotland after 16- and 17-year olds were given the vote. This change appears to have disrupted the usual lifecycle patterns for political engagement, with the decline in voter participation during early adulthood years - the mid-twenties - being smaller for those enfranchised at age 16. This shows these young people not only vote in higher numbers, they continue voting at ages where voter turnout is usually at its lowest. The report clearly demonstrates that advocating for a lowering of the voting age to 16 for all gives more people the opportunity to benefit from engaging with politics.” Report recommendations The report makes five recommendations for governments to overcome some of these inequalities and encourage lasting change in democratic engagement among young people beyond the act of voting. These include strengthening access to political literacy in schools, encouraging young people to engage with politics, and providing opportunities for democratic debate across all age groups in places such as workplaces and educational institutions. The team says more research could be done to understand why lowering the voting age initially reduces inequality in voter turnout and engagement but fails to last, and how that could be addressed in the future. The report is published by the University of Edinburgh in cooperation with the University of Sheffield and the think tank d|part. It is publicly available online on the University of Edinburgh’s School of Social and Political Science website.

Research published just before the first lockdown in March 2020 suggested young people in Wales had a "very limited" understanding of Welsh politics. Analysts from Beaufort Research spoke to 148 participants including 14 to 17-year-olds, disengaged adults and foreign nationals. Among the research it found there was: Lack of recognition over who was Wales' first minister Lack of understanding over what the Welsh government did Nevertheless the same researchers found that 72% of 16 to 17-year-olds did want the right to vote, compared with 12% against. And since then, the coronavirus pandemic has offered a whole new level of awareness of the differences in who makes the rules in different parts of the UK, with Google searches over the last 12 months in Wales alone showing how many more people tried to find out what specific rules applied in what nation. In February, polling by the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) and YouGov found 69% of 16 to 24-year-olds thought the Senedd elections were important - a higher proportion than in any other age group, except the over-65s. 'We pay taxes but couldn't decide who spends them' "From the age of just 16 you can legally give birth to a child and claim child tax credit, get married with parental consent, give consent to medical treatment that could change your life, join the Army, have an alcoholic drink with a meal, legally smoke cigarettes and the list goes on," said 16-year-old Georgie from Swansea. Georgie is looking forward to voting in an election for the first time And up to now, the BBC young reporter competition entrant added, "we even have to pay taxes, and yet we are prevented from electing the man or woman who decides how to spend them". "We still are being restrained from contributing to the choice of who is in charge of our country." Georgie believes there is a general lack of understanding about politics and wants more to be done to change this in order for younger people to play a more significant part in the UK political system. Who should I vote for? Compare party policies BBC Bitesize - Politics and democracy A really simple guide to the Welsh elections She feels more could be done in schools and colleges to educate people. "We need to understand how votes work," she said. "You need to be educated about the process of politics to be better informed and able to vote. "There's so many different perspectives and you have to hear the wider views," she added. "The debate that 16-year-olds should be allowed to vote has been around for many years, but now it is our turn to make it happen. "There are well over a million 16-year-olds alone in the UK, and one way of many ways to start is if we managed to get them to start and sign a petition - surely that would get us noticed? "That is the main point of this argument, to be noticed and have our say in our future. "I recently turned 16. I strongly believe that anyone who is not classified as a minor [16-year-olds are not] should be given the opportunity to have their voice heard in a legal manner and the only possible way in my mind is through gaining the right to vote." 'There's a stigma behind teenagers voting' David from Newport, is studying maths, business and physics. The 17-year-old said: "It's going to be the first official time we are going to be heard by the Senedd and people who want to listen to us. "You can't put a price on that." "You can't put a price" on getting your voice heard, David says He thinks "there's a stigma behind teenagers" when it comes to voting. "They are considered to be reckless, and people don't think they understand how the government and politics work, but there is a real drive for 16 and 17-year-olds to have a voice on ethical and social issues." He described himself as the "anomaly" among his friends because he likes listening to what politicians have to say. However, he thinks this is because "there's not anything in politics for young people". A year before the Senedd elections, young people were found to have a "limited understanding" For David, parties focusing on universities and bursaries is "not enough to make people talk about politics". He wants parties to focus more on education, particularly on apprenticeships and clearer curriculums, adding: "It [university] might not be the future that some young people see themselves going into." For those that are unsure about voting in the upcoming election, he said researching each party's manifesto will help people "truly understand what party is for you". 'It's our future just as much as it is anyone else's' Lisha, 17, from Wrexham, said 16 and 17-year-olds "deserve to have a say in what happens to us". "It's our future just as much as it is anyone else's," she said. However, she said a lot of her friends were not aware they could vote in the upcoming election, or do not fully understand what they would be voting for. Lisha says parties could do more to make politics more understandable for first-time voters "If the parties made more of an effort to make it understandable and promote it more, I think it would be better so more people my age would actually be interested in it." She wants to see parties consider the environment, equality and LGBTQ+ issues. The story of young voters in Wales so far Assembly grants vote to 16 and 17-year-olds Young people 'confused' by Welsh politics "It's clear people my age want to make a difference and voting is an incredible thing to let us be able to do that," she added. But Lisha stressed that politics needs to be made more accessible if parties want young people to "be more invested in our future". 'Voting allows us to shape our future' Joel, from Newport, is "excited" to be able to vote for the first time after turning 16 a couple of weeks ago. He thinks it is important because it "allows us to shape our future". Joel is continuing to educate himself about politics He said he does not "have the greatest knowledge of politics but more and more I'm looking into these things and what my vote would mean". Young people are increasingly being made aware of politics, with climate change and Brexit being talking points in school, he said. "It [politics] does come up, it's something you see in the news and something you're drawn to talking about. "I see adverts from parties on different apps like Instagram. "It helps in giving a greater understanding of what politics is and what it allows us to do." A really simple guide to the Welsh elections Welsh election 2021: Who should I vote for?

The UK should do the same This article is more than 11 months old Beth Riding A child in 2020 will see a 400% increase in global heating. An adult over 55 will see none. Yet only one of the two can vote Wed 29 May 2024 15.01 BST Last modified on Fri 31 May 2024 16.03 BST Share I know this country needs a change, so I couldn’t help but be disappointed when I saw that the general election is going to be held on the 4 July – just two months from my 18th birthday. Like many other young people across the country, I feel helpless when watching the actions of this government, knowing that I have no say over the decisions being made. Instead, we’re forced to watch older members of the public– especially the oldest, who turn out at the highest rate – cast their vote on what will ultimately impact us the most. This is perhaps most stark in the case of global heating. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a person who was a child in 2020 is projected to experience a nearly four-fold increase in extreme events during their lifetime under a 1.5°C increase of global temperature, and a five-fold increase under a 3°C increase, while a person aged 55-plus will not experience any of those changes in their remaining lifetime under any warming scenario. Despite this, 16- and 17-year-olds do not have a say in how the government tackles climate change. Instead, we have to sit back and watch as the UK grants 100 oil and gas production licences for the North Sea, and as Rishi Sunak flies in a jet from Leeds to London , a journey that would only take about two hours by train. While 16- to 17-year-olds can’t vote, they are, however, deemed mature enough to work, pay taxes and join the army; 17 year-olds can drive a car and donate blood. This is an argument that Keir Starmer made recently : if 16- and 17-year-olds are old enough to contribute to society in these ways, then how is it fair that aren’t able to have a can’t say in how that society is run? His comments suggested that Labour might make extending the vote to younger people part of its election manifesto. A voting age of 16 can already be seen in Scotland for local and Scottish parliamentary elections, where the outcome has been overwhelmingly positive. A report led by the University of Edinburgh’s School of Social and Political Science found that those who had been able to vote from 16 went to the ballot in greater numbers , and were more likely to continue voting as they entered their 20s, compared with those who had been able to vote from 18. Lowering the voting age would drive long-term behaviour – something that is desperately needed when it comes to general elections in the UK, after 32.7% of those eligible did not cast a vote in the 2019 general election. Similar results were seen in Austria, the first and still one of the only European countries to have a voting age of 16 in nationwide elections, where political interest among young people aged 16 and 17 increased after they were granted the right to vote, with the turnout of 16- and 17-year-olds exceeding the turnout of older first-time voters by eight to 10 percentage points in some regional elections. Current political science research shows that voting is a habit acquired early on in life, and is rarely broken once it has been formed. Many young people see politics as boring and corrupt, and therefore waste their vote, meaning that their voice isn’t heard. Lowering the voting age to 16 would encourage political engagement, a vital part of democracy. The expression of opinions, particularly by young people who have the power to effect change, is now more essential than ever to ensure that the future of the UK offers everyone equal opportunities and a safe living environment. The Conservative party has consistently failed young people over the course of its 14 years in power, with more than 270,000 children waiting for mental health treatment; an inflexible curriculum that drains the creativity out of children; and tuition fees that have risen from £3,000 to £9,250 per year, while repayment thresholds have been lowered, burdening students with debt and discouraging education. Yet the Conservatives seemingly continue to demonise our generation, promising to bring back national service , a somewhat Dickensian proposal, in order to “get young people out of their bubble” , when really all we need is to be treated with respect and allowed an electoral voice. In primary school, we are taught to speak up for ourselves, be curious and make our own decisions. Well, now is the time to practise what you preach, and let us have our say.

An earlier version suggested that 16-year-olds in the UK could give blood and drive a car when you must be 17 to do these things. It was further amended on 31 May 2024 to clarify that young people in Scotland can only vote in local and Scottish parliamentary elections. Also, tuition fees have risen from £3,000 to £9,350 under the Conservative government, not from £1,000.

The Edo Refinery is seeking to expand its production capacity by 6,000 barrels per day, the state’s governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has disclosed. He revealed this during the commissioning of Edo Refinery and Petrochemical Company Limited and other projects. He stated that investors began investing in the state’s refinery in 2017 which is now ready. In a statement, he said, “I am glad and can’t express how excited I am to formally cut the tape and walk through this facility. This is one of the first investments we encouraged investors to make way back in 2017. “To show our commitment, the State Government and EDSOGPADEC co-invested in this project. Like most projects, it has its own challenges but due to the doggedness of the promoters, they were able to overcome the challenges. This project is not only completed but we are looking at expanding by another 6,000 barrels per day.” Obaseki further lamented how the refinery is yet to get crude oil even though it is ready for use. He declared, “We are glad that the management of this company and project has remained steadfast and use this opportunity to appeal to the Federal Government to align with what the State is doing as we have done our own bid from this project. “We have raised the money, given them the land, communities supported, now the project is ready but no road to bring feedstock. We can’t get crude oil, which is required as feedstock into the project, meanwhile, we are a crude oil exporting country. “We are appealing to the Federal Government to support businesses and come to their aid to move this country forward. We will continue to support those businesses that have the raw materials to produce.” According to reports, the Edo backed Edo Modular Refinery, which has a capacity of 6,000bpd, can produce 50 per cent of diesel (500,000 litres), 25 percent of naphtha (300,000 litres) and 20 per cent of Low Pour Fuel Oil (LPFO) (200,000) litres. While commissioning a 3.65km Road in Ologbo, Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of the State, the Edo State governor stated that the road was constructed by Saro Africa under the state’s tax credit scheme. He highlighted that the scheme was targeted at revolutionising the government’s approach to financing infrastructure to support development. At the commissioning, he said, “First, it’s the first infrastructure tax credit project that we are undertaking in Edo State and by any sub-national. It’s only the national government that can be able to give tax credits for the purpose of infrastructure.” Related News How I fight as custodian of war deity– King Dakolo NNPCL under fire as $897m Warri refinery revamp flops NNPCL sells N336bn crude to Dangote, foreign refiners – Report Obaseki who also commissioned the Green Hill Ethanol Factory noted that the project will boost local production and job availability. Meanwhile, Obaseki, the chairman of the Board of Trustees, Alaghodaro Economic Summit Ltd/Gte, Dr Asue Ighodalo, and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, and other guests at the 2023 Alaghodaro Investment Summit have predicted that Edo State has the potential to become a more developed economy on account of its growth trajectory in the past seven years. They alleged that the state has witnessed an economic boom of over 140 percent from $10.6bn to $25.8bn. Ighodalo, who is also the Chairman of Sterling Bank Plc, in his address at the summit, stated that the summit has attracted about $4bn in the past seven years. He said, “Over the past seven years, Edo State has grown 140 per cent from an economy of $10.6bn to $25.8bn today, while Nigeria’s economy grew at 4 per cent. “Edo State can become a first world economy regardless of the challenges of Nigeria. The new investments attracted from new investors are put at $4bn sourced from Nigeria and from joint partnerships as the State has the capacity and will.” Also speaking at the event, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote, noted that Edo State has a comparative advantage over a lot of other states in agriculture and agro-processing as well as culture and tourism. Aliko, who was the keynote speaker at the 2023 Alaghodaro Investment Summit, was represented by the Dangote Group’s Managing Director, Mr Olakunle Alake, at the summit. He stated, “Edo State has a comparative advantage over every other State in the area of agriculture and agro-processing as well as tourism sectors. “Investments are coming into Edo State because of the friendly environment created by the governor for investors and today, Edo has become an investment destination. The State boasts of tourist sites across various locations in the State and the State Government has taken advantage of it to turn the State into a tourism hub.” Dangote added that the ease of doing business in the state was a point of attraction for investors to invest. Also speaking at the event, the governor, Obaseki, disclosed that the state has introduced a computerised system for its civil service. He added that the state has continuously increased its monthly IGR since 2016.

Verdict Four correct, one understated and one unproven Source Kenya’s chief justice, David Maraga (August 2020) This article is more than 4 years old Maraga was largely correct about the judiciary budget and how many Kenyans are served per judge and magistrate in the country. The chief justice was also correct that the number of cases filed in Kenyan courts every year exceeds the number of cases the judiciary settles by as much as 100,000, causing an ever-growing backlog. But there isn’t evidence of a global average for comparing the number of judges and magistrates per population – there are too many variables in different legal systems. To mark the tenth anniversary of Kenya’s constitution , broadcaster NTV interviewed current and former government officials on how the law has been applied. Chief justice David Maraga told NTV that while the 2010 constitution had sought to strengthen the judiciary’s independence, funding was a perennial headache. “[Budget cuts] hit the judiciary sometimes to a point that its operations grind to a halt,” Maraga said in the interview , published in August 2020. In recent months the chief justice has been vocal on how cuts have hampered the delivery of judicial services. In his interview, Maraga made several claims. We looked into their accuracy. Claim The judiciary does not even get 1% of the national budget Verdict correct Maraga, who assumed office in 2016, asked for more funding as “the judiciary does not even get 1% of the national budget”. “We have said, over and over again, that for the judiciary to operate properly we should get at least 2.5% of the national budget,” he said . Africa Check has previously found there isn’t a “recommended global percentage” of funding for the judiciary from the national budget. In 2018 Maraga also claimed it was 2.5%. To determine how much has been allocated to the judiciary in recent years we consulted the appropriation acts, the laws that show budget allocations to government departments. For the national budget, we checked budget statements. Judiciary amounts as share of Kenya budget Year Judiciary budget (KSh billion) National budget (KSh trillion) Share 2014/15 17.5 1.58 1.1% 2015/16 16.7 2 0.8% 2016/17 17.3 2.3 0.8% 2017/18 17.6 2.3 0.8% 2018/19 14.5 2.6 0.6% 2019/20 18.9 2.8 0.7% 2020/21 17.4 2.8 0.6% Sources: Budget speeches for 2020 , 2019 , 2018 , 2017 , 2016 , 2015 and 2014 and Appropriations Acts for 2020, 2019 , 2018 , 2017 , 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . Note: The figures shown have been rounded up. Only once in the last seven financial years, in 2014/15, did the judiciary receive more than 1% of the national budget. We therefore rate this claim as correct. Claim We have an average of 400,000 cases being filed in our courts every year Verdict correct The most recent state of the judiciary report covers the 2018/19 financial year. Released in January 2020, it shows that more than two million cases were lodged in all courts between 2014/15 and 2018/19. The report said : “The number of filed cases provides quantitative information on the extent of demand for court services by the public.” Total number of cases filed in the judiciary Financial year Cases 2014/15 334,685 2015/16 460,961 2016/17 344,180 2017/18 402,243 2018/19 484,349 Average 405,283 The average number of cases filed in the period covered by the report works out to 405,283 a year. We therefore rate this claim as correct. Claim We only dispose of about 300,000 cases Verdict correct Discussing the country’s case backlog, Maraga said the judiciary settles about 300,000 cases every year. This number was determined by the number of judges and magistrates and would only continue to pile up. “Unless the judiciary is given enough resources to have enough manpower, Kenyans will continue crying about delayed cases,” he said . The most recent state of the judiciary report has data covering 2014/15 to 2018/19. It shows an average of 321,652 cases settled across the five financial years. As of 2018/19 there were 153 judges and 546 magistrates in Kenya. Number of cases resolved by the judiciary Financial year Cases 2014/15 272,605 2015/16 191,625 2016/17 304,182 2017/18 370,488 2018/19 469,359 Average 321,652 We therefore rate the claim as correct. Claim In Kenya now with a population of about 48 million, we have one judge serving over 300,000 people Verdict correct There are 47.6 million people in Kenya, according to 2019 census data. The most recent data from the judiciary shows there were 153 judges as of June 2019. This works out to one judge for every 311,000 people. We rate this claim as correct. Claim We have one magistrate serving over 77,000 people Verdict understated The most recent data from the judiciary shows there were 546 magistrates in Kenya as of June 2019. The state of the judiciary report was released in January 2020. Using a population of 47.6 million , this works out to one magistrate for every 87,114 people. The chief justice’s figure was off by over 10,000 but it was still “over 77,000” people per magistrate. We therefore rate it as understated. Claim There is a ‘global average’ for the number of judges and magistrates to number of people Verdict unproven A calculation for a “global average” can be achieved by directly comparing the number of judges and magistrates to the world population. But to account for population differences, rates (per 100,000 people) are widely used . ( Note: See box below for more context. ) The chief justice has in the past spoken of a “recommended global percentage” of funding for the judiciary. We have contacted the judiciary for the source of the "global average" cited by the chief justice and will update this report with their response. Wachira Maina is a constitutional lawyer in Kenya who has written about the progress of institutions, including the judiciary, following the adoption of the 2010 constitution. He directed us to the UN Office of Drug and Crime (UNODC) for data on the administration of justice professionals against a country’s population. It shows there were 1.3 judges or magistrates for every 100,000 people in Kenya in 2014, 3.6 for South Africa in 2015, and 0.8 for the US and 8.7 for China in 2017. But the UNODC noted key weaknesses in the data when comparing countries. “The numbers reported are not restricted to judges deciding criminal cases,” it said. “The comparability problem might get even worse because some countries might still only report the number of judges whose duty is the judgment of criminal cases. “Apart from this, it is not clear whether really all judges are included in the reported figures in all countries.” Without a source for the chief justice’s claim of a global average, we can only rate this final claim as unproven. Is calculating the ratio of judges and magistrates to the population useful? The ratio of judges and magistrates to the population is useful depending on what you’re using it to show, Wachira Maina , a constitutional lawyer in Kenya told Africa Check. He gave an example of using the ratio of the number of doctors to the population as a metric for access to health, and of police officers to measure access to security services. However, he said, ratio data leaves a lot unstated, such as the distribution by region and by urban and rural areas. Therefore “to determine access to services, you will almost certainly need additional information”. “A high ratio by itself does not prove that most people have access to services, merely that if services were equitably distributed, and they rarely are, more people would have access,” Maina said. “Keep in mind though that you cannot increase access unless you have the numbers, so the ratio does still say something useful.” Chris Kerkering is a litigation manager at Katiba Institute , an organisation in Nairobi that promotes the knowledge of Kenya’s constitution. He told Africa Check that population does not automatically equate to a judge’s caseload. A very litigious society would have more cases per population, he said. Caseload and caseload weighting, which Kerkering described as not only counting the number of cases but also being able to determine how much time each respective case would take , may be the best way to determine whether a judiciary has the appropriate number of judges. But since doing a comparison between different countries with different legal systems and different cultures would be near impossible, “judges per population is a decent aggregate”, Kerkering said. He said the chief justice’s focus was on access to justice. “If there are not enough judges and the staff that support them then they are unable to provide the services that the judiciary requires. Case backlogs become one of the more obvious problems. Fewer judges mean that each judge is taking more cases.” “The more cases a judge has, the more time it takes to get through them. Access to justice requires timely decisions. The phrase ‘justice delayed is justice denied,’ is so commonly used for a reason. Often, as a case winds its way through the court system, avoidable delays result in long term harm.” “A judiciary that can’t get through its caseload promptly can’t ensure access to justice as required by the constitution.” Carlos Mureithi is a journalist based in Nairobi, Kenya Further reading: https://africacheck.org/reports/budget-cuts-hit-kenyas-judiciary-but-theres-no-global-funding-target/ Republish our content for free We believe that everyone needs the facts.

Verdict Four correct, one understated and one unproven Source Kenya’s chief justice, David Maraga (August 2020) This article is more than 4 years old Maraga was largely correct about the judiciary budget and how many Kenyans are served per judge and magistrate in the country. The chief justice was also correct that the number of cases filed in Kenyan courts every year exceeds the number of cases the judiciary settles by as much as 100,000, causing an ever-growing backlog. But there isn’t evidence of a global average for comparing the number of judges and magistrates per population – there are too many variables in different legal systems. To mark the tenth anniversary of Kenya’s constitution , broadcaster NTV interviewed current and former government officials on how the law has been applied. Chief justice David Maraga told NTV that while the 2010 constitution had sought to strengthen the judiciary’s independence, funding was a perennial headache. “[Budget cuts] hit the judiciary sometimes to a point that its operations grind to a halt,” Maraga said in the interview , published in August 2020. In recent months the chief justice has been vocal on how cuts have hampered the delivery of judicial services. In his interview, Maraga made several claims. We looked into their accuracy. Claim The judiciary does not even get 1% of the national budget Verdict correct Maraga, who assumed office in 2016, asked for more funding as “the judiciary does not even get 1% of the national budget”. “We have said, over and over again, that for the judiciary to operate properly we should get at least 2.5% of the national budget,” he said . Africa Check has previously found there isn’t a “recommended global percentage” of funding for the judiciary from the national budget. In 2018 Maraga also claimed it was 2.5%. To determine how much has been allocated to the judiciary in recent years we consulted the appropriation acts, the laws that show budget allocations to government departments. For the national budget, we checked budget statements. Judiciary amounts as share of Kenya budget Year Judiciary budget (KSh billion) National budget (KSh trillion) Share 2014/15 17.5 1.58 1.1% 2015/16 16.7 2 0.8% 2016/17 17.3 2.3 0.8% 2017/18 17.6 2.3 0.8% 2018/19 14.5 2.6 0.6% 2019/20 18.9 2.8 0.7% 2020/21 17.4 2.8 0.6% Sources: Budget speeches for 2020 , 2019 , 2018 , 2017 , 2016 , 2015 and 2014 and Appropriations Acts for 2020, 2019 , 2018 , 2017 , 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . Note: The figures shown have been rounded up. Only once in the last seven financial years, in 2014/15, did the judiciary receive more than 1% of the national budget. We therefore rate this claim as correct. Claim We have an average of 400,000 cases being filed in our courts every year Verdict correct The most recent state of the judiciary report covers the 2018/19 financial year. Released in January 2020, it shows that more than two million cases were lodged in all courts between 2014/15 and 2018/19. The report said : “The number of filed cases provides quantitative information on the extent of demand for court services by the public.” Total number of cases filed in the judiciary Financial year Cases 2014/15 334,685 2015/16 460,961 2016/17 344,180 2017/18 402,243 2018/19 484,349 Average 405,283 The average number of cases filed in the period covered by the report works out to 405,283 a year. We therefore rate this claim as correct. Claim We only dispose of about 300,000 cases Verdict correct Discussing the country’s case backlog, Maraga said the judiciary settles about 300,000 cases every year. This number was determined by the number of judges and magistrates and would only continue to pile up. “Unless the judiciary is given enough resources to have enough manpower, Kenyans will continue crying about delayed cases,” he said . The most recent state of the judiciary report has data covering 2014/15 to 2018/19. It shows an average of 321,652 cases settled across the five financial years. As of 2018/19 there were 153 judges and 546 magistrates in Kenya. Number of cases resolved by the judiciary Financial year Cases 2014/15 272,605 2015/16 191,625 2016/17 304,182 2017/18 370,488 2018/19 469,359 Average 321,652 We therefore rate the claim as correct. Claim In Kenya now with a population of about 48 million, we have one judge serving over 300,000 people Verdict correct There are 47.6 million people in Kenya, according to 2019 census data. The most recent data from the judiciary shows there were 153 judges as of June 2019. This works out to one judge for every 311,000 people. We rate this claim as correct. Claim We have one magistrate serving over 77,000 people Verdict understated The most recent data from the judiciary shows there were 546 magistrates in Kenya as of June 2019. The state of the judiciary report was released in January 2020. Using a population of 47.6 million , this works out to one magistrate for every 87,114 people. The chief justice’s figure was off by over 10,000 but it was still “over 77,000” people per magistrate. We therefore rate it as understated. Claim There is a ‘global average’ for the number of judges and magistrates to number of people Verdict unproven A calculation for a “global average” can be achieved by directly comparing the number of judges and magistrates to the world population. But to account for population differences, rates (per 100,000 people) are widely used . ( Note: See box below for more context. ) The chief justice has in the past spoken of a “recommended global percentage” of funding for the judiciary. We have contacted the judiciary for the source of the "global average" cited by the chief justice and will update this report with their response. Wachira Maina is a constitutional lawyer in Kenya who has written about the progress of institutions, including the judiciary, following the adoption of the 2010 constitution. He directed us to the UN Office of Drug and Crime (UNODC) for data on the administration of justice professionals against a country’s population. It shows there were 1.3 judges or magistrates for every 100,000 people in Kenya in 2014, 3.6 for South Africa in 2015, and 0.8 for the US and 8.7 for China in 2017. But the UNODC noted key weaknesses in the data when comparing countries. “The numbers reported are not restricted to judges deciding criminal cases,” it said. “The comparability problem might get even worse because some countries might still only report the number of judges whose duty is the judgment of criminal cases. “Apart from this, it is not clear whether really all judges are included in the reported figures in all countries.” Without a source for the chief justice’s claim of a global average, we can only rate this final claim as unproven. Is calculating the ratio of judges and magistrates to the population useful? The ratio of judges and magistrates to the population is useful depending on what you’re using it to show, Wachira Maina , a constitutional lawyer in Kenya told Africa Check. He gave an example of using the ratio of the number of doctors to the population as a metric for access to health, and of police officers to measure access to security services. However, he said, ratio data leaves a lot unstated, such as the distribution by region and by urban and rural areas. Therefore “to determine access to services, you will almost certainly need additional information”. “A high ratio by itself does not prove that most people have access to services, merely that if services were equitably distributed, and they rarely are, more people would have access,” Maina said. “Keep in mind though that you cannot increase access unless you have the numbers, so the ratio does still say something useful.” Chris Kerkering is a litigation manager at Katiba Institute , an organisation in Nairobi that promotes the knowledge of Kenya’s constitution. He told Africa Check that population does not automatically equate to a judge’s caseload. A very litigious society would have more cases per population, he said. Caseload and caseload weighting, which Kerkering described as not only counting the number of cases but also being able to determine how much time each respective case would take , may be the best way to determine whether a judiciary has the appropriate number of judges. But since doing a comparison between different countries with different legal systems and different cultures would be near impossible, “judges per population is a decent aggregate”, Kerkering said.

The 2019 Census was conducted under the provisions of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 (Fourth Schedule Part 1 Item 11), the Statistics (Amendment) Act, 2019 and the Statistics (Census of Population) Order, 2018 – Legal Notice No. 205. The theme of the census was “Counting Our People for Sustainable Development and Devolution of Services”. This was in response to the demand for statistical information for implementation of Kenya’s development agenda such as the Big Four and Vision 2030 and other global initiatives including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The preparations for the 2019 census commenced in 2016 with Cartographic Mapping. Other preparatory activities undertaken included development of tools, pilot census, recruitment and training, and publicity and advocacy. The enumeration was successfully conducted from 24th/25th to 31st August 2019 and a mop-up exercise carried out on 1st and 2nd of September 2019, to cover those not enumerated during the seven days. To ensure data quality, field supervision followed a three tier structure (Coordinators, ICT and Content Supervisors) to support real-time response to emerging issues. The enumeration process was also monitored by independent observers drawn from the international community and national statistics offices across Africa. The collected data was encrypted and successfully transmitted to servers through a secure ICT infrastructure. The data that was collected has undergone validation checks as guided by the UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics and the UN Handbook on Editing of Census Data.

In this cross-sectional study, 11,523 adolescents and young adults aged 14–21 years who perceived an impact of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on their mental health reported the frequencies of depression and anxiety symptoms retrospectively for different pre-pandemic and pandemic phases. Data were collected using web-based questionnaires between January 5th and February 20th, 2022. Depression and anxiety were assessed with a modified version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). Scale-fit cut-offs were used to identify pre-existing elevated depression and anxiety scores. Multilevel mixed linear models were conducted to assess changes in depression and anxiety symptoms from 2019 to 2021 and compare for age, gender and pre-pandemic mental health problems. Among young people who were experiencing mental health changes as a result of the pandemic, the frequency of depression and anxiety symptoms increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. This association was moderated by age, gender, and pre-existing elevated depression/anxiety scores. For young people without elevated pre-pandemic depression/anxiety, the scores increased strongly over time, with 61% reporting elevated depression symptoms and 44% reporting elevated anxiety symptoms in 2021. In contrast, self-perceived change was minimal for adolescents and young adults with elevated pre-pandemic depression and anxiety. Among young people whose mental health has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the group without pre-pandemic mental health conditions reported greater deterioration than those with elevated pre-pandemic depression and anxiety scores. Thus, adolescents and young adults without pre-existing depression and anxiety problems who perceived a change in general mental health due to the pandemic reported an alarming increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic period.

For example, the pandemic has led to lockdowns, school closures, and many public area restrictions to control the spread of the virus. A growing body of international literature reports an increase in mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 . These findings indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on youth mental health, particularly with symptoms of depression and anxiety. According to a meta-analysis by Racine et al. 6 , the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms has doubled since the onset of the pandemic with increasing rates later in the pandemic. Severe restrictions due to lockdown measures, greater limitations of social contacts, and greater perceived changes in life were associated with further mental health impairments 10 . Perceived threat, a potential loss of daily routines, and the loss of positive reinforcers in consequence of restricted social contacts and leisure activities increased the risk of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the COVID-19 pandemic context 11 , 12 . Within adult cohorts, younger age and female gender were associated with higher mental health burden 1 , 13 , 14 , whereas within cohorts of children and adolescents older age and female gender were associated with impaired mental health 3 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 15 , 16 . Besides age and gender, different findings suggest pre-pandemic mental health conditions as another risk factor 1 , 13 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 . Studies observed a higher prevalence of psychopathological symptoms during the pandemic for persons with pre-pandemic mental illness 13 , 18 suggesting that this group experienced a greater burden from the pandemic. However, other research suggested that people without pre-pandemic mental health conditions experienced greater deterioration 20 . For example, students with pre-existing mental health concerns showed improving or similar mental health during the pandemic whereas students without pre-existing mental health concerns were more likely to show declining mental health 18 . The authors speculated that the reason for the decline in mental health in groups with no pre-existing mental problems was the response to social isolation as a new, unprecedented situation. Several German studies found similar results concerning the pandemic’s influence on young persons’ general mental health: during the COVID-19 pandemic, children and adolescents showed continuously increasing emotional problems, a decrease in quality of life, and reported more frequent depression and anxiety symptoms 22 , 23 , 24 . Similarly, German adults reported increased symptoms of anxiety and depression, with over 50% suffering from fear and psychological distress regarding the COVID-19 pandemic during the first lockdown in 2020 25 , 26 . Again, female and younger adults reported more mental health problems 24 , 26 . To our knowledge, only a few studies have assessed pre-pandemic mental health status as a predictor of pandemic-related changes in mental health 18 , 20 , and none conducted in Germany. Evidence regarding this topic has been restricted to the first stage of the pandemic (May 2020) and adult samples 20 . Therefore, the objectives of the study were to examine the self-reported perceived changes of depression and anxiety symptoms in adolescents and young adults with and without pre-existing problems during the different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic using a retrospective design, considering the influence of age and gender. Based on the findings from previous studies 18 , 20 we hypothesized that depression and anxiety symptoms would increase during the pandemic among adolescents without pre-pandemic depression or anxiety, but no particular changes for persons with elevated pre-pandemic depression or anxiety would be observed. We also hypothesized that the female gender and older age would be associated with a greater deterioration. Methods Study design and sample Data were derived from a large cross-sectional study on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on substance use, media consumption, and mental health among adolescents and young adults in Germany. The data were collected between January 5th and February 20th, 2022 using a web-based questionnaire. Participants were recruited via age-group-specific advertisements on Facebook and Instagram. This method was successfully used in previous studies 27 . By clicking on the link in the advertisements, adolescents and young adults received access to the questionnaire. Information about the survey and protection of data privacy was displayed. Consent was given when continuing the questionnaire. The data collection took place when Germany was in the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, with high restrictions due to high COVID-19 infection cases and public health regulations that stipulate what liberties will be regained by people who are vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 (see Fig. 1 ). Figure 1 COVID-19 pandemic stages 28 . Full size image Overall, 14,129 female and male adolescents and young adults provided data on mental health. The inclusion criterion for the main analyses was a pandemic-related change of the general mental health assessed with the following question: “What would you say, did your psychological wellbeing change as a result of the corona pandemic? That is, whether the pandemic has made you feel different (e.g., happier or sadder, more relaxed or restless)”. Answering choices were “ No, the pandemic had no impact”, “Yes, I was doing much better than before the pandemic.”, Yes, I was doing better than before the pandemic”, “Yes, I felt worse than before the pandemic”, “Yes, I felt much worse than before the pandemic”. If a pandemic-related change was indicated (every other answer than “No, the pandemic had no impact”), conditional questions about depression and anxiety were asked. In total, N = 11,523 female and male adolescents and young adults aged 14 to 21 answered retrospective questions about depression and anxiety in different periods before and during of the pandemic. Measures Primary outcomes. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using a modified version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-4 29 (modification: translated to German, adapted to easy language, response scale was modified from a 4-point-Likert-scale to a 21-point slider); (e.g. “How often have you felt down, depressed, irritable, or hopeless?” ). The PHQ-4 is a widely used questionnaire with good reliability and validity to screen for depression and anxiety symptoms in the general population 29 , 30 , 31 . On a slider from "not at all" (0) to "almost every day" (20), the participants rated for the periods "2019 (before the corona pandemic)", "2020 (beginning of the corona pandemic)" and "2021 (ongoing corona pandemic)” how often they experienced the described symptoms of depression and anxiety. The scale has been modified to improve recall accuracy, as this can be achieved with broader answering categories 32 . For each of the three periods, a total score was calculated for the depression and anxiety subscales (each subscale with a total score ranging from 0 to 40). Higher scores indicated higher levels of depression or anxiety. The established cut-off 29 , 30 , 31 , 33 was transferred to the used answering scale. Scores equal to 20 or above were categorized as elevated depression/anxiety scores. Different studies have shown, that retrospective self-reports of mental health are reliable at the group level 32 , 34 . Sociodemographic correlates/variables. The survey included questions on age, gender (male coded as 0, female coded as 1), job-related status (student coded as 1, university student coded as 2, trainee as 3, employed et al. as 4, other as 5). Subjective social status was measured with a German translation of the MacArthur Scale, ranging from zero (low income, the worst jobs, the lowest education) to 10 (high income, the best jobs, the highest education) 35 , 36 . Data analyses Depression and anxiety scores were calculated as described above. According to their indicated value of depression and anxiety symptoms in 2019 (before the pandemic) participants were categorized into two groups: with and without elevated pre-pandemic depression (N = 2309 and N = 9214, respectively) or anxiety (N = 1990 and N = 9533, respectively). Further, two groups were created based on participants’ age: adolescents (14–17 years) and young adults (18–21 years). Only complete cases were analysed. First, the prevalence of the pandemic-related changes in general health were reported among full sample (N = 14,129). In addition, bivariate comparisons for gender, age and pre-pandemic mental health status were calculated using chi-square-tests. Second, the prevalence of elevated scores for depression and anxiety before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and the scales’ mean scores were reported for the analytic sample (N = 11,523). In addition, the statistics were also reported for both groups (with vs. without elevated pre-pandemic depression/anxiety scores). Further, bivariate comparisons between the groups were calculated using chi-square-tests, and t-tests. Third, mixed linear models were set up to estimate the relationship between the outcome depression (and anxiety, respectively) and the Level 1 predictors: COVID-19 periods (categorical), pre-pandemic mental health conditions, age group and gender. Subjective social status and job-related status were added to the model as covariates. Random slopes for individual-specific effects (Level 2) nested within the repeated measures predictor (Level 3) were added. Next, we tested for interactions of all four predictors. Maximum-Likelihood estimation was used, and non-standardized coefficients were calculated. Post-hoc analysis of estimated marginal means (EMMs) was done to examine further relevant differences. Non-standardized beta coefficients (β) and differences between the EMMs with 95% CIs were reported with statistical significance set at p < 0.05 (2-tailed). Bonferroni multiple-testing corrections were applied to control the false-discovery rate at 0.05 All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata (SE 17.0) 37 . Ethics approval Ethical approval was obtained from the ethical committee of the German Psychological Society ( Ethikkommission der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Psychologie , ID: HanewinkelReiner2021-10-21VA). Informed consent All participants within this study provided informed consent. Data protection profile and information have been written in easy language to be understandable for young readers. The survey data was completely anonymous. According to Recital 26 of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) “the principals of data protection [including article 8(1)] should […] not apply to anonymous information […]. This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous information, including for statistical or research purposes.” Therefore, no parental consent was needed for adolescents with minimum age of 14 years participating in our anonymous survey. Results Sample characteristics The study sample consisted of 6945 (49.2%) adolescents (14–17 years) and 7184 (50.8%) young adults (18–21 years), 48.4% identified as male and 51.6% as female. The average age was 17.7 years (SD = 2.3). Other demographic characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Table 1 Participant characteristics for the study sample (N = 14,129). Full size table Pandemic-related change in the general mental health In the study sample (N = 14,129), a pandemic-related change in general mental health was observed in 81.6% of adolescents and young adults. Overall, 13.9% felt better during the pandemic, 67.6% felt worse, and 18.4% reported no change in mental health status. Females and young adults were more likely to report negative changes in mental health compared to males and adolescents (gender: χ 2 = 504.3, p < 0.001; age: χ 2 = 133.8, p < 0.001; see Fig. 2 ). Figure 2 Changes in the general mental health reported by gender (males vs. females) and age group (adolescents vs. young adults) (N = 14,129). Full size image Among those reporting a change in general mental health (N = 11,523), individuals with pre-pandemic mental health problems were more likely to report improvement in general mental health due to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to individuals without pre-pandemic mental health problems (depression: 23.6% vs. 15.4%, χ 2 = 86.8, p < 0.001; anxiety: 23.7% vs. 15.7%, χ 2 = 73.8, p < 0.001). Changes in depression symptoms Descriptive analysis showed increasing numbers of depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic with 20.0% reporting elevated depression symptoms before the pandemic, 43.9% in the first (2020) and 63.4% in the second year (2021) of the pandemic (see Table 2 ). Table 2 Parameters of the PHQ-4 depression and anxiety subscales for different periods before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 11,523) in both groups (with vs. without pre-pandemic depression/anxiety). Full size table The mixed model predicting depression scores (N = 11,523) revealed a significant main effect of time (β 2020 = 7.7, 95% CI: 7.5–7.9; β 2021 = 12.6, 95% CI: 12.4–12.9), controlling for all other predictors. Depression scores grew significantly over time, EMMs in 2019: 11.1 (95% CI: 11.0–11.2), 2020: 18.8 (95% CI: 18.6–19.0), 2021: 23.7 (95% CI: 23.5–23.9). Interactions of all predictors with time were significant at p < 0.001. Contrasts for two-way-interactions are presented in Table 3 . Females reported higher depression scores compared to males for each pandemic period with increasing differences over time. No differences were found between the age groups in 2019, but with the pandemic’s onset young adults reported increasingly higher depression scores compared to adolescents. Among participants without elevated pre-pandemic depression symptoms (N = 9214) the depression scores increased strongly over time, EMMs in 2019: 7.2 (95% CI: 7.0–7.3), 2020: 17.0 (95% CI: 16.8–17.2), 2021: 23.2 (95% CI: 23.0–23.4). In contrast, for those with elevated pre-pandemic depression (N = 2309) the scores decreased marginally in the first pandemic year and then stayed stable in the second year, EMMs 2019: 26.7 (95% CI: 26.5–26.9), 2020: 25.9 (95% CI: 25.6–26.3), 2021: 25.8 (95% CI: 25.4–26.3). Table 3 Post-hoc calculated contrasts within the linear mixed model (N = 11,523) for depression and anxiety scores with pandemic period, gender, age group and pre-pandemic depression/anxiety status as fixed effects and individual-specific random effects nested within the time variable, adjusted for job-related status and subjective social status. Full size table EMMs and 95% CIs for the four-way interaction of time with age group, gender, and pre-pandemic depression status are shown in Fig. 3 . Average depression scores of females (both age groups) and male young adults without elevated pre-pandemic depression passed the applied scale-fit 20-point-cut-off in 2021, EMMs for 18–21-year-old males: 22.0 (95% CI: 21.5–22.4), 14–17-year-old females: 24.8 (95% CI: 24.4–25.3), 18–21-year-old females: 24.9 (95% CI: 24.5–25.4). For male adolescents without elevated pre-pandemic depression, the average depression score in 2021 was not significantly different from the 20-point-cut-off, EMM = 20.0 (95% CI: 19.5–20.5). Figure 3 Estimated marginal means and 95% CIs on the depression ( a ) and anxiety ( b ) subscale across time, gender, age groups and pre-pandemic depression/anxiety status (with vs. without elevated symptoms) (N = 11,523). Full size image Among participants with elevated pre-pandemic depression symptoms, the depression scores decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 for male adolescents only (diff = − 2.5, 95% CI: − 3.8 to − 1.1), but not for the other three age/gender groups. From 2020 to 2021 the depression scores remained stable. Overall respondents with elevated pre-pandemic depression symptoms had significantly higher depression scores than those without pre-pandemic depression but with diminishing differences over time, the difference in 2021 for 14–17-year-old males: 3.1 (95% CI: 1.5–4.7), 14–17-year-old females: 1.7 (95% CI: 0.4–3.1), 18–21-year-old males: 3.1 (95% CI: 1.6–4.7), 18–21-year-old females: 2.7 (95% CI: 1.4–3.9). Changes in anxiety symptoms Regarding anxiety, increasing numbers of symptoms were observed during the pandemic with 17.8% reporting elevated symptoms in 2019, 38.4% in the first, and 51.1% in the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic (see Table 2 ). The mixed model predicting anxiety scores (N = 11,523) revealed a significant main effect of time (β 2020 = 6.5, 95% CI: 6.3–6.7; β 2021 = 10.1, 95% CI: 9.9–10.3), controlling for all other predictors. Anxiety scores grew significantly over time, EMMs in 2019: 10.3 (95% CI: 10.2–10.4), 2020: 16.8 (95% CI: 16.6–17.0), 2021: 20.4 (95% CI: 20.2–20.6). Interactions of all predictors with time were significant at p < 0.001. Contrasts for two-way interactions are presented in Table 3 . Females reported higher anxiety scores compared to males with increasing differences over time. Young adults reported marginally higher pre-pandemic anxiety scores compared to adolescents and increasingly higher scores during the pandemic. Among participants without elevated pre-pandemic anxiety symptoms (N = 9533) the anxiety scores increased strongly over time, EMMs in 2019: 6.5 (95% CI: 6.4–6.6), 2020: 14.4 (95% CI: 14.2–14.6), 2021: 18.7 (95% CI: 18.5–18.9). In contrast, for those with elevated pre-pandemic anxiety (N = 1990) the scores stayed stable during the pandemic, EMMs 2019: 28.5 (95% CI: 28.2–28.7), 2020: 28.3 (95% CI: 27.9–28.7), 2021: 28.6 (95% CI: 28.1–29.1). EMMs and 95% CI for the four-way-interaction of time with age group, gender, and pre-pandemic anxiety status are shown in Fig. 3 . Average anxiety scores for females (both age groups) without elevated pre-pandemic anxiety status passed the applied scale-fit 20-point-cut-off in 2021, while it remained significantly below cut-off points for males (both age groups); EMMs for 14–17-year-old males: 14.5 (95% CI: 14.1–15.0), 14–17-year-old females: 20.9 (95% CI: 20.5–21.3), 18–21 year-old males: 16.6 (95% CI: 16.1–17.0), 18–21-year-old females: 21.4 (95% CI: 21.0–21.8). In the group with elevated pre-pandemic anxiety symptoms the anxiety scores for male adolescents decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 (diff = − 1.7, 95% CI: − 3.2 to − 0.3), while the scores increased marginally for female young adults (diff = 0.9, 95% CI: 0.1–1.9) and remained unchanged for female adolescents and male young adults. From 2020 to 2021 the scores remained stable. Over all periods of time respondents with elevated pre-pandemic anxiety symptoms had significantly higher anxiety scores compared to those without pre-pandemic anxiety but with diminishing differences over time, the difference in 2021 for 14–17-year-old males: 11.4 (95% CI: 9.5–13.3), 14–17-year-old females: 9.5 (95% CI: 8.0–11.0), 18–21-year-old males: 10.4 (95% CI: 8.7–12.2), 18–21-year-old females: 8.8 (95% CI: 7.5–10.0). Discussion Key findings In this cross-sectional study with 14,129 adolescents and young adults aged 14 to 21 years from Germany, the majority (81.6%) reported a COVID-19 pandemic-related change in general mental health. For those who perceived a COVID-19 pandemic-related change in general mental health, different trajectories for individuals with and without pre-pandemic elevated depression and anxiety symptoms were observed. In contrast to those with elevated pre-pandemic depression and anxiety scores, adolescents and young adults without pre-existing depression and anxiety problems reported an alarming increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Limitations There are several limitations of this study that must be considered when interpreting the results below. The cross-sectional design limits the ability to infer causality. Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed retrospectively for different periods in the last three years instead of using a longitudinal design with repeated measures, resulting in subjective data and the risk of recall and memory biases. However, past research has shown that subjective mental health data elicited using retrospective questions are consistent at the aggregate level 32 . To reduce recall and memory biases, introductory texts or summary questions as well as specific anchor points can help respondents to remember their psychological health status 32 . The onset of the pandemic is a very remarkable anchor point. Further, short texts were used to help respondents to recall the different periods. Asking broader questions and offering broader answering categories may also help to increase recall accuracy 32 . For this reason, we used a wider scale and sliders instead of a 4-point Likert scale. Depression and anxiety were assessed using only two-item subscales, but with good validity in the original version 30 , 31 , 33 . The scales serve as screening instruments, only assessing major symptoms of the underlying mental disorders. Furthermore, the wording of the items was adapted to simple language and the response scale was modified from a 4-point-Likert-scale to a 21-point slider. This new scale has not been validated. The reasons for the modification lie in the retrospective nature of the questions. The use of an indirect measure method does not ensure that reported changes are caused only by the COVID-19 pandemic. It does not control for confounding critical life events. However, the results are consistent with reported changes assessed with the direct measure examining the impact of the pandemic on mental health. Furthermore, we had to use filter questions in the questionnaire due to economic reasons and only asked those who indicated that their mental health was affected by the pandemic in more detail about depression and anxiety. Hence, the reported depression and anxiety levels only include those who are vulnerable to their general mental health being affected by the pandemic situation. Therefore, the levels of depression and anxiety were not analysed in the group of adolescents and young adults who experienced no pandemic-related changes in their general mental health—however, this only comprises a small group with 18% of the total sample. Individuals who did not perceive any changes should report stable depression and anxiety scores over the pandemic phases. Nevertheless, it remains unanswered in the present study whether adolescents and young adults who have not experienced pandemic-related changes had pre-pandemic elevated anxiety and depression scores or not. Hence, the results can only be generalized to the subpopulation that self-perceived a pandemic-related change in their mental health. Finally, the PHQ-4 should not be used for diagnostic classification, it serves as a screening tool in the sense of a "first step" approach. Therefore, prevalence estimates for adolescents and young adults with depression/anxiety disorders cannot be derived from our findings. Rather, the results are estimates for those who are at an increased risk of having depression or anxiety disorders. However, further diagnostics are urgently required for the group at risk. Interpretation The increase in depression and anxiety which we have found in the majority of those adolescents and young adults, who experienced a COVID-19 pandemic-related impact on their general mental health, has also been observed in other countries 3 , 38 , 39 . We found that the changes were larger for depression symptoms than for anxiety ones. Six out of ten met the screening criteria for depression in 2021, which is three times the size compared to what it was before the COVID-19 pandemic. Five out of ten met the screening criteria for anxiety in 2021, compared to less than two in 2019. Loss of peer interactions, ongoing social isolation, financial difficulties, missed milestones, restricted leisure activities and school disruptions are just some burdens the pandemic and the infection control measures put on adolescents and young adults, being possibly responsible for the negative changes in general mental health since the pandemic’s beginning. As those restrictions accumulated during the ongoing pandemic, the mental burden got worse resulting in further aggravation of depression and anxiety symptoms over time. Ravens-Sieberer and colleagues 24 found similar higher mental health burdens in the later waves of the pandemic compared to the first month after the pandemic’s onset. Racine and colleagues also observed increasing rates of depression and anxiety later in the pandemic 6 . Social media use played an important role during the COVID-19 pandemic as it provided an opportunity to stay in touch with friends and family, thereby reducing negative mental health effects such as loneliness, anxiety, and depression 40 . Not only has social media use increased, but virtual conferencing became ubiquitous in the lives of people of all ages. Even though social media and video-conferencing platforms supported human interactions in times with strict lockdown measures, the increased use may be linked with other mental health issues, such as body dysmorphia due to constant access to one’s appearance 41 . Further advantages and disadvantages of social media use in the context of COVID-19 are discussed by Sarangi et al. 40 . Gender is an important predictor for pandemic-related changes in depression and anxiety. Regarding risk factors for negative changes, findings indicate that females are more vulnerable to the adverse effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on their mental health. This finding is supported by other studies 3 , 17 , 38 . Age also had a significant but smaller effect with young adults showing more symptoms of depression and anxiety compared to adolescents with diverging trajectories over the pandemic. However, the female gender as well as older age within the observed age groups were already associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression before the COVID-19 pandemic 42 , 43 . In addition, different groups are disproportionally affected by the pandemic restrictions due to other life events; for instance, young adults graduating from school and moving out of town during the COVID-19 pandemic may have limited opportunities to meet new people or may have limited ability to spend a year abroad. Different studies observed that increased feelings of loneliness within groups of adolescents and young adults were strongly associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety during the pandemic 9 , 13 , 16 , 44 . Furthermore, Tetreault et al. stated that more disruptions in daily life as well as school and extracurricular activities were associated with increased symptoms of anxiety and depression 4 . Explaining the gender differences, Thorisdottir et al. 3 argue that females have an increased sensitivity to interpersonal stressors due to hormonal influences and are more likely to engage in social behaviour to cope with stress which was not possible during the pandemic 45 , 46 . This assertion is supported by the finding, that females reported greater changes in loneliness compared to males 9 The most important differences were found regarding the pre-pandemic mental state. Although a pandemic-related change in general mental health was reported by all adolescents and young adults in the analysis sample, those with elevated pre-pandemic depression or anxiety scores reported no or only marginal changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, alarming changes were reported by those who had no elevated depression or anxiety symptoms before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. They reported a significant increase in depression as well as anxiety in the first pandemic year and ongoing aggravation in the second year. One reason for this phenomenon could be the presence of a measurement limitation called the ceiling effect. However, this is contradicted by the observation that the estimated marginal means in the group with pre-existing mental health problems were well below the upper limit of the scale. Moreover, about one-fourth of participants in the group with pre-existing mental problems reported feeling better because of the pandemic, compared to only 15–16% in the group without pre-existing mental problems. Few other studies analysed the impact of pre-pandemic mental health and reported similar findings 17 , 18 . Persons with pre-pandemic mental health conditions still reported higher levels of symptoms during the pandemic but those without pre-pandemic mental health conditions reported greater deterioration. As reported by Hamza et al., one possible reason may be that feelings of social isolation and loneliness are associated with greater mental health symptoms 18 . Persons without pre-existing mental health concerns reported increased social isolation and loneliness while those with pre-pandemic mental health concerns reported no change. The authors argue that this second group already felt socially isolated and lonely before the pandemic. One further assumption might be that persons with pre-pandemic depression or anxiety disorder experienced short-term symptom relief because of the avoiding character of the staying-at-home guidelines 47 . Implications Adolescents and young adults are at high risk of being negatively mentally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic especially those without pre-pandemic elevated depression and anxiety. It is possible, that individuals will show improving mental health with the proceeding relaxation of the pandemic and accompanying measures. Society should give young people the chance to resume normal everyday life and to catch up on missed opportunities from the last two years. Concerning the other part of adolescents and young adults having difficulties improving their mental health, the public health system should offer low-threshold help for this vulnerable group to deal with the impact of the pandemic and to acquire functional coping strategies. Possibly, school-based mental health professional work should be expanded both online and in-person to help youth process the negative impact of the pandemic and improve coping skills. Teachers and parents should be sensitised to recognize and address mental health problems. Additionally, low-threshold offers should also be established in other institutions such as universities to reach young adults after school. There is also a need for national efforts, involving health authorities, to ease the stigma surrounding mental illness 48 . Further research should concentrate on follow-up measurements to monitor future developments, especially when the pandemic no longer dictates everyday life, and identify young people that show ongoing high levels of depression and/or anxiety to offer specific help.

In this cross-sectional study, 11,523 adolescents and young adults aged 14–21 years who perceived an impact of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on their mental health reported the frequencies of depression and anxiety symptoms retrospectively for different pre-pandemic and pandemic phases. Data were collected using web-based questionnaires between January 5th and February 20th, 2022. Depression and anxiety were assessed with a modified version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). Scale-fit cut-offs were used to identify pre-existing elevated depression and anxiety scores. Multilevel mixed linear models were conducted to assess changes in depression and anxiety symptoms from 2019 to 2021 and compare for age, gender and pre-pandemic mental health problems. Among young people who were experiencing mental health changes as a result of the pandemic, the frequency of depression and anxiety symptoms increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. This association was moderated by age, gender, and pre-existing elevated depression/anxiety scores. For young people without elevated pre-pandemic depression/anxiety, the scores increased strongly over time, with 61% reporting elevated depression symptoms and 44% reporting elevated anxiety symptoms in 2021. In contrast, self-perceived change was minimal for adolescents and young adults with elevated pre-pandemic depression and anxiety. Among young people whose mental health has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the group without pre-pandemic mental health conditions reported greater deterioration than those with elevated pre-pandemic depression and anxiety scores. Thus, adolescents and young adults without pre-existing depression and anxiety problems who perceived a change in general mental health due to the pandemic reported an alarming increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic period.

For example, the pandemic has led to lockdowns, school closures, and many public area restrictions to control the spread of the virus. A growing body of international literature reports an increase in mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 . These findings indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on youth mental health, particularly with symptoms of depression and anxiety. According to a meta-analysis by Racine et al. 6 , the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms has doubled since the onset of the pandemic with increasing rates later in the pandemic. Severe restrictions due to lockdown measures, greater limitations of social contacts, and greater perceived changes in life were associated with further mental health impairments 10 . Perceived threat, a potential loss of daily routines, and the loss of positive reinforcers in consequence of restricted social contacts and leisure activities increased the risk of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the COVID-19 pandemic context 11 , 12 . Within adult cohorts, younger age and female gender were associated with higher mental health burden 1 , 13 , 14 , whereas within cohorts of children and adolescents older age and female gender were associated with impaired mental health 3 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 15 , 16 . Besides age and gender, different findings suggest pre-pandemic mental health conditions as another risk factor 1 , 13 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 . Studies observed a higher prevalence of psychopathological symptoms during the pandemic for persons with pre-pandemic mental illness 13 , 18 suggesting that this group experienced a greater burden from the pandemic. However, other research suggested that people without pre-pandemic mental health conditions experienced greater deterioration 20 . For example, students with pre-existing mental health concerns showed improving or similar mental health during the pandemic whereas students without pre-existing mental health concerns were more likely to show declining mental health 18 . The authors speculated that the reason for the decline in mental health in groups with no pre-existing mental problems was the response to social isolation as a new, unprecedented situation. Several German studies found similar results concerning the pandemic’s influence on young persons’ general mental health: during the COVID-19 pandemic, children and adolescents showed continuously increasing emotional problems, a decrease in quality of life, and reported more frequent depression and anxiety symptoms 22 , 23 , 24 . Similarly, German adults reported increased symptoms of anxiety and depression, with over 50% suffering from fear and psychological distress regarding the COVID-19 pandemic during the first lockdown in 2020 25 , 26 . Again, female and younger adults reported more mental health problems 24 , 26 . To our knowledge, only a few studies have assessed pre-pandemic mental health status as a predictor of pandemic-related changes in mental health 18 , 20 , and none conducted in Germany. Evidence regarding this topic has been restricted to the first stage of the pandemic (May 2020) and adult samples 20 . Therefore, the objectives of the study were to examine the self-reported perceived changes of depression and anxiety symptoms in adolescents and young adults with and without pre-existing problems during the different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic using a retrospective design, considering the influence of age and gender. Based on the findings from previous studies 18 , 20 we hypothesized that depression and anxiety symptoms would increase during the pandemic among adolescents without pre-pandemic depression or anxiety, but no particular changes for persons with elevated pre-pandemic depression or anxiety would be observed. We also hypothesized that the female gender and older age would be associated with a greater deterioration. Methods Study design and sample Data were derived from a large cross-sectional study on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on substance use, media consumption, and mental health among adolescents and young adults in Germany. The data were collected between January 5th and February 20th, 2022 using a web-based questionnaire. Participants were recruited via age-group-specific advertisements on Facebook and Instagram. This method was successfully used in previous studies 27 . By clicking on the link in the advertisements, adolescents and young adults received access to the questionnaire. Information about the survey and protection of data privacy was displayed. Consent was given when continuing the questionnaire. The data collection took place when Germany was in the fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, with high restrictions due to high COVID-19 infection cases and public health regulations that stipulate what liberties will be regained by people who are vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 (see Fig. 1 ). Figure 1 COVID-19 pandemic stages 28 . Full size image Overall, 14,129 female and male adolescents and young adults provided data on mental health. The inclusion criterion for the main analyses was a pandemic-related change of the general mental health assessed with the following question: “What would you say, did your psychological wellbeing change as a result of the corona pandemic? That is, whether the pandemic has made you feel different (e.g., happier or sadder, more relaxed or restless)”. Answering choices were “ No, the pandemic had no impact”, “Yes, I was doing much better than before the pandemic.”, Yes, I was doing better than before the pandemic”, “Yes, I felt worse than before the pandemic”, “Yes, I felt much worse than before the pandemic”. If a pandemic-related change was indicated (every other answer than “No, the pandemic had no impact”), conditional questions about depression and anxiety were asked. In total, N = 11,523 female and male adolescents and young adults aged 14 to 21 answered retrospective questions about depression and anxiety in different periods before and during of the pandemic. Measures Primary outcomes. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using a modified version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-4 29 (modification: translated to German, adapted to easy language, response scale was modified from a 4-point-Likert-scale to a 21-point slider); (e.g. “How often have you felt down, depressed, irritable, or hopeless?” ). The PHQ-4 is a widely used questionnaire with good reliability and validity to screen for depression and anxiety symptoms in the general population 29 , 30 , 31 . On a slider from "not at all" (0) to "almost every day" (20), the participants rated for the periods "2019 (before the corona pandemic)", "2020 (beginning of the corona pandemic)" and "2021 (ongoing corona pandemic)” how often they experienced the described symptoms of depression and anxiety. The scale has been modified to improve recall accuracy, as this can be achieved with broader answering categories 32 . For each of the three periods, a total score was calculated for the depression and anxiety subscales (each subscale with a total score ranging from 0 to 40). Higher scores indicated higher levels of depression or anxiety. The established cut-off 29 , 30 , 31 , 33 was transferred to the used answering scale. Scores equal to 20 or above were categorized as elevated depression/anxiety scores. Different studies have shown, that retrospective self-reports of mental health are reliable at the group level 32 , 34 . Sociodemographic correlates/variables. The survey included questions on age, gender (male coded as 0, female coded as 1), job-related status (student coded as 1, university student coded as 2, trainee as 3, employed et al. as 4, other as 5). Subjective social status was measured with a German translation of the MacArthur Scale, ranging from zero (low income, the worst jobs, the lowest education) to 10 (high income, the best jobs, the highest education) 35 , 36 . Data analyses Depression and anxiety scores were calculated as described above. According to their indicated value of depression and anxiety symptoms in 2019 (before the pandemic) participants were categorized into two groups: with and without elevated pre-pandemic depression (N = 2309 and N = 9214, respectively) or anxiety (N = 1990 and N = 9533, respectively). Further, two groups were created based on participants’ age: adolescents (14–17 years) and young adults (18–21 years). Only complete cases were analysed. First, the prevalence of the pandemic-related changes in general health were reported among full sample (N = 14,129). In addition, bivariate comparisons for gender, age and pre-pandemic mental health status were calculated using chi-square-tests. Second, the prevalence of elevated scores for depression and anxiety before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and the scales’ mean scores were reported for the analytic sample (N = 11,523). In addition, the statistics were also reported for both groups (with vs. without elevated pre-pandemic depression/anxiety scores). Further, bivariate comparisons between the groups were calculated using chi-square-tests, and t-tests. Third, mixed linear models were set up to estimate the relationship between the outcome depression (and anxiety, respectively) and the Level 1 predictors: COVID-19 periods (categorical), pre-pandemic mental health conditions, age group and gender. Subjective social status and job-related status were added to the model as covariates. Random slopes for individual-specific effects (Level 2) nested within the repeated measures predictor (Level 3) were added. Next, we tested for interactions of all four predictors. Maximum-Likelihood estimation was used, and non-standardized coefficients were calculated. Post-hoc analysis of estimated marginal means (EMMs) was done to examine further relevant differences. Non-standardized beta coefficients (β) and differences between the EMMs with 95% CIs were reported with statistical significance set at p < 0.05 (2-tailed). Bonferroni multiple-testing corrections were applied to control the false-discovery rate at 0.05 All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata (SE 17.0) 37 . Ethics approval Ethical approval was obtained from the ethical committee of the German Psychological Society ( Ethikkommission der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Psychologie , ID: HanewinkelReiner2021-10-21VA). Informed consent All participants within this study provided informed consent. Data protection profile and information have been written in easy language to be understandable for young readers. The survey data was completely anonymous. According to Recital 26 of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) “the principals of data protection [including article 8(1)] should […] not apply to anonymous information […]. This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous information, including for statistical or research purposes.” Therefore, no parental consent was needed for adolescents with minimum age of 14 years participating in our anonymous survey. Results Sample characteristics The study sample consisted of 6945 (49.2%) adolescents (14–17 years) and 7184 (50.8%) young adults (18–21 years), 48.4% identified as male and 51.6% as female. The average age was 17.7 years (SD = 2.3). Other demographic characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Table 1 Participant characteristics for the study sample (N = 14,129). Full size table Pandemic-related change in the general mental health In the study sample (N = 14,129), a pandemic-related change in general mental health was observed in 81.6% of adolescents and young adults. Overall, 13.9% felt better during the pandemic, 67.6% felt worse, and 18.4% reported no change in mental health status. Females and young adults were more likely to report negative changes in mental health compared to males and adolescents (gender: χ 2 = 504.3, p < 0.001; age: χ 2 = 133.8, p < 0.001; see Fig. 2 ). Figure 2 Changes in the general mental health reported by gender (males vs. females) and age group (adolescents vs. young adults) (N = 14,129). Full size image Among those reporting a change in general mental health (N = 11,523), individuals with pre-pandemic mental health problems were more likely to report improvement in general mental health due to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to individuals without pre-pandemic mental health problems (depression: 23.6% vs. 15.4%, χ 2 = 86.8, p < 0.001; anxiety: 23.7% vs. 15.7%, χ 2 = 73.8, p < 0.001). Changes in depression symptoms Descriptive analysis showed increasing numbers of depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic with 20.0% reporting elevated depression symptoms before the pandemic, 43.9% in the first (2020) and 63.4% in the second year (2021) of the pandemic (see Table 2 ). Table 2 Parameters of the PHQ-4 depression and anxiety subscales for different periods before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 11,523) in both groups (with vs. without pre-pandemic depression/anxiety). Full size table The mixed model predicting depression scores (N = 11,523) revealed a significant main effect of time (β 2020 = 7.7, 95% CI: 7.5–7.9; β 2021 = 12.6, 95% CI: 12.4–12.9), controlling for all other predictors. Depression scores grew significantly over time, EMMs in 2019: 11.1 (95% CI: 11.0–11.2), 2020: 18.8 (95% CI: 18.6–19.0), 2021: 23.7 (95% CI: 23.5–23.9). Interactions of all predictors with time were significant at p < 0.001. Contrasts for two-way-interactions are presented in Table 3 . Females reported higher depression scores compared to males for each pandemic period with increasing differences over time. No differences were found between the age groups in 2019, but with the pandemic’s onset young adults reported increasingly higher depression scores compared to adolescents. Among participants without elevated pre-pandemic depression symptoms (N = 9214) the depression scores increased strongly over time, EMMs in 2019: 7.2 (95% CI: 7.0–7.3), 2020: 17.0 (95% CI: 16.8–17.2), 2021: 23.2 (95% CI: 23.0–23.4). In contrast, for those with elevated pre-pandemic depression (N = 2309) the scores decreased marginally in the first pandemic year and then stayed stable in the second year, EMMs 2019: 26.7 (95% CI: 26.5–26.9), 2020: 25.9 (95% CI: 25.6–26.3), 2021: 25.8 (95% CI: 25.4–26.3). Table 3 Post-hoc calculated contrasts within the linear mixed model (N = 11,523) for depression and anxiety scores with pandemic period, gender, age group and pre-pandemic depression/anxiety status as fixed effects and individual-specific random effects nested within the time variable, adjusted for job-related status and subjective social status. Full size table EMMs and 95% CIs for the four-way interaction of time with age group, gender, and pre-pandemic depression status are shown in Fig. 3 . Average depression scores of females (both age groups) and male young adults without elevated pre-pandemic depression passed the applied scale-fit 20-point-cut-off in 2021, EMMs for 18–21-year-old males: 22.0 (95% CI: 21.5–22.4), 14–17-year-old females: 24.8 (95% CI: 24.4–25.3), 18–21-year-old females: 24.9 (95% CI: 24.5–25.4). For male adolescents without elevated pre-pandemic depression, the average depression score in 2021 was not significantly different from the 20-point-cut-off, EMM = 20.0 (95% CI: 19.5–20.5). Figure 3 Estimated marginal means and 95% CIs on the depression ( a ) and anxiety ( b ) subscale across time, gender, age groups and pre-pandemic depression/anxiety status (with vs. without elevated symptoms) (N = 11,523). Full size image Among participants with elevated pre-pandemic depression symptoms, the depression scores decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 for male adolescents only (diff = − 2.5, 95% CI: − 3.8 to − 1.1), but not for the other three age/gender groups. From 2020 to 2021 the depression scores remained stable. Overall respondents with elevated pre-pandemic depression symptoms had significantly higher depression scores than those without pre-pandemic depression but with diminishing differences over time, the difference in 2021 for 14–17-year-old males: 3.1 (95% CI: 1.5–4.7), 14–17-year-old females: 1.7 (95% CI: 0.4–3.1), 18–21-year-old males: 3.1 (95% CI: 1.6–4.7), 18–21-year-old females: 2.7 (95% CI: 1.4–3.9). Changes in anxiety symptoms Regarding anxiety, increasing numbers of symptoms were observed during the pandemic with 17.8% reporting elevated symptoms in 2019, 38.4% in the first, and 51.1% in the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic (see Table 2 ). The mixed model predicting anxiety scores (N = 11,523) revealed a significant main effect of time (β 2020 = 6.5, 95% CI: 6.3–6.7; β 2021 = 10.1, 95% CI: 9.9–10.3), controlling for all other predictors. Anxiety scores grew significantly over time, EMMs in 2019: 10.3 (95% CI: 10.2–10.4), 2020: 16.8 (95% CI: 16.6–17.0), 2021: 20.4 (95% CI: 20.2–20.6). Interactions of all predictors with time were significant at p < 0.001. Contrasts for two-way interactions are presented in Table 3 . Females reported higher anxiety scores compared to males with increasing differences over time. Young adults reported marginally higher pre-pandemic anxiety scores compared to adolescents and increasingly higher scores during the pandemic. Among participants without elevated pre-pandemic anxiety symptoms (N = 9533) the anxiety scores increased strongly over time, EMMs in 2019: 6.5 (95% CI: 6.4–6.6), 2020: 14.4 (95% CI: 14.2–14.6), 2021: 18.7 (95% CI: 18.5–18.9). In contrast, for those with elevated pre-pandemic anxiety (N = 1990) the scores stayed stable during the pandemic, EMMs 2019: 28.5 (95% CI: 28.2–28.7), 2020: 28.3 (95% CI: 27.9–28.7), 2021: 28.6 (95% CI: 28.1–29.1). EMMs and 95% CI for the four-way-interaction of time with age group, gender, and pre-pandemic anxiety status are shown in Fig. 3 . Average anxiety scores for females (both age groups) without elevated pre-pandemic anxiety status passed the applied scale-fit 20-point-cut-off in 2021, while it remained significantly below cut-off points for males (both age groups); EMMs for 14–17-year-old males: 14.5 (95% CI: 14.1–15.0), 14–17-year-old females: 20.9 (95% CI: 20.5–21.3), 18–21 year-old males: 16.6 (95% CI: 16.1–17.0), 18–21-year-old females: 21.4 (95% CI: 21.0–21.8). In the group with elevated pre-pandemic anxiety symptoms the anxiety scores for male adolescents decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 (diff = − 1.7, 95% CI: − 3.2 to − 0.3), while the scores increased marginally for female young adults (diff = 0.9, 95% CI: 0.1–1.9) and remained unchanged for female adolescents and male young adults. From 2020 to 2021 the scores remained stable. Over all periods of time respondents with elevated pre-pandemic anxiety symptoms had significantly higher anxiety scores compared to those without pre-pandemic anxiety but with diminishing differences over time, the difference in 2021 for 14–17-year-old males: 11.4 (95% CI: 9.5–13.3), 14–17-year-old females: 9.5 (95% CI: 8.0–11.0), 18–21-year-old males: 10.4 (95% CI: 8.7–12.2), 18–21-year-old females: 8.8 (95% CI: 7.5–10.0). Discussion Key findings In this cross-sectional study with 14,129 adolescents and young adults aged 14 to 21 years from Germany, the majority (81.6%) reported a COVID-19 pandemic-related change in general mental health. For those who perceived a COVID-19 pandemic-related change in general mental health, different trajectories for individuals with and without pre-pandemic elevated depression and anxiety symptoms were observed. In contrast to those with elevated pre-pandemic depression and anxiety scores, adolescents and young adults without pre-existing depression and anxiety problems reported an alarming increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Limitations There are several limitations of this study that must be considered when interpreting the results below. The cross-sectional design limits the ability to infer causality. Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed retrospectively for different periods in the last three years instead of using a longitudinal design with repeated measures, resulting in subjective data and the risk of recall and memory biases. However, past research has shown that subjective mental health data elicited using retrospective questions are consistent at the aggregate level 32 . To reduce recall and memory biases, introductory texts or summary questions as well as specific anchor points can help respondents to remember their psychological health status 32 . The onset of the pandemic is a very remarkable anchor point. Further, short texts were used to help respondents to recall the different periods. Asking broader questions and offering broader answering categories may also help to increase recall accuracy 32 . For this reason, we used a wider scale and sliders instead of a 4-point Likert scale. Depression and anxiety were assessed using only two-item subscales, but with good validity in the original version 30 , 31 , 33 . The scales serve as screening instruments, only assessing major symptoms of the underlying mental disorders. Furthermore, the wording of the items was adapted to simple language and the response scale was modified from a 4-point-Likert-scale to a 21-point slider. This new scale has not been validated. The reasons for the modification lie in the retrospective nature of the questions. The use of an indirect measure method does not ensure that reported changes are caused only by the COVID-19 pandemic. It does not control for confounding critical life events. However, the results are consistent with reported changes assessed with the direct measure examining the impact of the pandemic on mental health. Furthermore, we had to use filter questions in the questionnaire due to economic reasons and only asked those who indicated that their mental health was affected by the pandemic in more detail about depression and anxiety. Hence, the reported depression and anxiety levels only include those who are vulnerable to their general mental health being affected by the pandemic situation. Therefore, the levels of depression and anxiety were not analysed in the group of adolescents and young adults who experienced no pandemic-related changes in their general mental health—however, this only comprises a small group with 18% of the total sample. Individuals who did not perceive any changes should report stable depression and anxiety scores over the pandemic phases. Nevertheless, it remains unanswered in the present study whether adolescents and young adults who have not experienced pandemic-related changes had pre-pandemic elevated anxiety and depression scores or not. Hence, the results can only be generalized to the subpopulation that self-perceived a pandemic-related change in their mental health. Finally, the PHQ-4 should not be used for diagnostic classification, it serves as a screening tool in the sense of a "first step" approach. Therefore, prevalence estimates for adolescents and young adults with depression/anxiety disorders cannot be derived from our findings. Rather, the results are estimates for those who are at an increased risk of having depression or anxiety disorders. However, further diagnostics are urgently required for the group at risk. Interpretation The increase in depression and anxiety which we have found in the majority of those adolescents and young adults, who experienced a COVID-19 pandemic-related impact on their general mental health, has also been observed in other countries 3 , 38 , 39 . We found that the changes were larger for depression symptoms than for anxiety ones. Six out of ten met the screening criteria for depression in 2021, which is three times the size compared to what it was before the COVID-19 pandemic. Five out of ten met the screening criteria for anxiety in 2021, compared to less than two in 2019. Loss of peer interactions, ongoing social isolation, financial difficulties, missed milestones, restricted leisure activities and school disruptions are just some burdens the pandemic and the infection control measures put on adolescents and young adults, being possibly responsible for the negative changes in general mental health since the pandemic’s beginning. As those restrictions accumulated during the ongoing pandemic, the mental burden got worse resulting in further aggravation of depression and anxiety symptoms over time. Ravens-Sieberer and colleagues 24 found similar higher mental health burdens in the later waves of the pandemic compared to the first month after the pandemic’s onset. Racine and colleagues also observed increasing rates of depression and anxiety later in the pandemic 6 . Social media use played an important role during the COVID-19 pandemic as it provided an opportunity to stay in touch with friends and family, thereby reducing negative mental health effects such as loneliness, anxiety, and depression 40 . Not only has social media use increased, but virtual conferencing became ubiquitous in the lives of people of all ages. Even though social media and video-conferencing platforms supported human interactions in times with strict lockdown measures, the increased use may be linked with other mental health issues, such as body dysmorphia due to constant access to one’s appearance 41 . Further advantages and disadvantages of social media use in the context of COVID-19 are discussed by Sarangi et al. 40 . Gender is an important predictor for pandemic-related changes in depression and anxiety. Regarding risk factors for negative changes, findings indicate that females are more vulnerable to the adverse effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on their mental health. This finding is supported by other studies 3 , 17 , 38 . Age also had a significant but smaller effect with young adults showing more symptoms of depression and anxiety compared to adolescents with diverging trajectories over the pandemic. However, the female gender as well as older age within the observed age groups were already associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression before the COVID-19 pandemic 42 , 43 . In addition, different groups are disproportionally affected by the pandemic restrictions due to other life events; for instance, young adults graduating from school and moving out of town during the COVID-19 pandemic may have limited opportunities to meet new people or may have limited ability to spend a year abroad. Different studies observed that increased feelings of loneliness within groups of adolescents and young adults were strongly associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety during the pandemic 9 , 13 , 16 , 44 . Furthermore, Tetreault et al. stated that more disruptions in daily life as well as school and extracurricular activities were associated with increased symptoms of anxiety and depression 4 . Explaining the gender differences, Thorisdottir et al. 3 argue that females have an increased sensitivity to interpersonal stressors due to hormonal influences and are more likely to engage in social behaviour to cope with stress which was not possible during the pandemic 45 , 46 . This assertion is supported by the finding, that females reported greater changes in loneliness compared to males 9 The most important differences were found regarding the pre-pandemic mental state. Although a pandemic-related change in general mental health was reported by all adolescents and young adults in the analysis sample, those with elevated pre-pandemic depression or anxiety scores reported no or only marginal changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, alarming changes were reported by those who had no elevated depression or anxiety symptoms before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. They reported a significant increase in depression as well as anxiety in the first pandemic year and ongoing aggravation in the second year. One reason for this phenomenon could be the presence of a measurement limitation called the ceiling effect. However, this is contradicted by the observation that the estimated marginal means in the group with pre-existing mental health problems were well below the upper limit of the scale. Moreover, about one-fourth of participants in the group with pre-existing mental problems reported feeling better because of the pandemic, compared to only 15–16% in the group without pre-existing mental problems. Few other studies analysed the impact of pre-pandemic mental health and reported similar findings 17 , 18 . Persons with pre-pandemic mental health conditions still reported higher levels of symptoms during the pandemic but those without pre-pandemic mental health conditions reported greater deterioration. As reported by Hamza et al., one possible reason may be that feelings of social isolation and loneliness are associated with greater mental health symptoms 18 . Persons without pre-existing mental health concerns reported increased social isolation and loneliness while those with pre-pandemic mental health concerns reported no change. The authors argue that this second group already felt socially isolated and lonely before the pandemic. One further assumption might be that persons with pre-pandemic depression or anxiety disorder experienced short-term symptom relief because of the avoiding character of the staying-at-home guidelines 47 . Implications Adolescents and young adults are at high risk of being negatively mentally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic especially those without pre-pandemic elevated depression and anxiety. It is possible, that individuals will show improving mental health with the proceeding relaxation of the pandemic and accompanying measures. Society should give young people the chance to resume normal everyday life and to catch up on missed opportunities from the last two years. Concerning the other part of adolescents and young adults having difficulties improving their mental health, the public health system should offer low-threshold help for this vulnerable group to deal with the impact of the pandemic and to acquire functional coping strategies. Possibly, school-based mental health professional work should be expanded both online and in-person to help youth process the negative impact of the pandemic and improve coping skills. Teachers and parents should be sensitised to recognize and address mental health problems. Additionally, low-threshold offers should also be established in other institutions such as universities to reach young adults after school. There is also a need for national efforts, involving health authorities, to ease the stigma surrounding mental illness 48 . Further research should concentrate on follow-up measurements to monitor future developments, especially when the pandemic no longer dictates everyday life, and identify young people that show ongoing high levels of depression and/or anxiety to offer specific help.

Verdict Four correct, one understated and one unproven Source Kenya’s chief justice, David Maraga (August 2020) This article is more than 4 years old Maraga was largely correct about the judiciary budget and how many Kenyans are served per judge and magistrate in the country. The chief justice was also correct that the number of cases filed in Kenyan courts every year exceeds the number of cases the judiciary settles by as much as 100,000, causing an ever-growing backlog. But there isn’t evidence of a global average for comparing the number of judges and magistrates per population – there are too many variables in different legal systems. To mark the tenth anniversary of Kenya’s constitution , broadcaster NTV interviewed current and former government officials on how the law has been applied. Chief justice David Maraga told NTV that while the 2010 constitution had sought to strengthen the judiciary’s independence, funding was a perennial headache. “[Budget cuts] hit the judiciary sometimes to a point that its operations grind to a halt,” Maraga said in the interview , published in August 2020. In recent months the chief justice has been vocal on how cuts have hampered the delivery of judicial services. In his interview, Maraga made several claims. We looked into their accuracy. Claim The judiciary does not even get 1% of the national budget Verdict correct Maraga, who assumed office in 2016, asked for more funding as “the judiciary does not even get 1% of the national budget”. “We have said, over and over again, that for the judiciary to operate properly we should get at least 2.5% of the national budget,” he said . Africa Check has previously found there isn’t a “recommended global percentage” of funding for the judiciary from the national budget. In 2018 Maraga also claimed it was 2.5%. To determine how much has been allocated to the judiciary in recent years we consulted the appropriation acts, the laws that show budget allocations to government departments. For the national budget, we checked budget statements. Judiciary amounts as share of Kenya budget Year Judiciary budget (KSh billion) National budget (KSh trillion) Share 2014/15 17.5 1.58 1.1% 2015/16 16.7 2 0.8% 2016/17 17.3 2.3 0.8% 2017/18 17.6 2.3 0.8% 2018/19 14.5 2.6 0.6% 2019/20 18.9 2.8 0.7% 2020/21 17.4 2.8 0.6% Sources: Budget speeches for 2020 , 2019 , 2018 , 2017 , 2016 , 2015 and 2014 and Appropriations Acts for 2020, 2019 , 2018 , 2017 , 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . Note: The figures shown have been rounded up. Only once in the last seven financial years, in 2014/15, did the judiciary receive more than 1% of the national budget. We therefore rate this claim as correct. Claim We have an average of 400,000 cases being filed in our courts every year Verdict correct The most recent state of the judiciary report covers the 2018/19 financial year. Released in January 2020, it shows that more than two million cases were lodged in all courts between 2014/15 and 2018/19. The report said : “The number of filed cases provides quantitative information on the extent of demand for court services by the public.” Total number of cases filed in the judiciary Financial year Cases 2014/15 334,685 2015/16 460,961 2016/17 344,180 2017/18 402,243 2018/19 484,349 Average 405,283 The average number of cases filed in the period covered by the report works out to 405,283 a year. We therefore rate this claim as correct. Claim We only dispose of about 300,000 cases Verdict correct Discussing the country’s case backlog, Maraga said the judiciary settles about 300,000 cases every year. This number was determined by the number of judges and magistrates and would only continue to pile up. “Unless the judiciary is given enough resources to have enough manpower, Kenyans will continue crying about delayed cases,” he said . The most recent state of the judiciary report has data covering 2014/15 to 2018/19. It shows an average of 321,652 cases settled across the five financial years. As of 2018/19 there were 153 judges and 546 magistrates in Kenya. Number of cases resolved by the judiciary Financial year Cases 2014/15 272,605 2015/16 191,625 2016/17 304,182 2017/18 370,488 2018/19 469,359 Average 321,652 We therefore rate the claim as correct. Claim In Kenya now with a population of about 48 million, we have one judge serving over 300,000 people Verdict correct There are 47.6 million people in Kenya, according to 2019 census data. The most recent data from the judiciary shows there were 153 judges as of June 2019. This works out to one judge for every 311,000 people. We rate this claim as correct. Claim We have one magistrate serving over 77,000 people Verdict understated The most recent data from the judiciary shows there were 546 magistrates in Kenya as of June 2019. The state of the judiciary report was released in January 2020. Using a population of 47.6 million , this works out to one magistrate for every 87,114 people. The chief justice’s figure was off by over 10,000 but it was still “over 77,000” people per magistrate. We therefore rate it as understated. Claim There is a ‘global average’ for the number of judges and magistrates to number of people Verdict unproven A calculation for a “global average” can be achieved by directly comparing the number of judges and magistrates to the world population. But to account for population differences, rates (per 100,000 people) are widely used . ( Note: See box below for more context. ) The chief justice has in the past spoken of a “recommended global percentage” of funding for the judiciary. We have contacted the judiciary for the source of the "global average" cited by the chief justice and will update this report with their response. Wachira Maina is a constitutional lawyer in Kenya who has written about the progress of institutions, including the judiciary, following the adoption of the 2010 constitution. He directed us to the UN Office of Drug and Crime (UNODC) for data on the administration of justice professionals against a country’s population. It shows there were 1.3 judges or magistrates for every 100,000 people in Kenya in 2014, 3.6 for South Africa in 2015, and 0.8 for the US and 8.7 for China in 2017. But the UNODC noted key weaknesses in the data when comparing countries. “The numbers reported are not restricted to judges deciding criminal cases,” it said. “The comparability problem might get even worse because some countries might still only report the number of judges whose duty is the judgment of criminal cases. “Apart from this, it is not clear whether really all judges are included in the reported figures in all countries.” Without a source for the chief justice’s claim of a global average, we can only rate this final claim as unproven. Is calculating the ratio of judges and magistrates to the population useful? The ratio of judges and magistrates to the population is useful depending on what you’re using it to show, Wachira Maina , a constitutional lawyer in Kenya told Africa Check. He gave an example of using the ratio of the number of doctors to the population as a metric for access to health, and of police officers to measure access to security services. However, he said, ratio data leaves a lot unstated, such as the distribution by region and by urban and rural areas. Therefore “to determine access to services, you will almost certainly need additional information”. “A high ratio by itself does not prove that most people have access to services, merely that if services were equitably distributed, and they rarely are, more people would have access,” Maina said. “Keep in mind though that you cannot increase access unless you have the numbers, so the ratio does still say something useful.” Chris Kerkering is a litigation manager at Katiba Institute , an organisation in Nairobi that promotes the knowledge of Kenya’s constitution. He told Africa Check that population does not automatically equate to a judge’s caseload. A very litigious society would have more cases per population, he said. Caseload and caseload weighting, which Kerkering described as not only counting the number of cases but also being able to determine how much time each respective case would take , may be the best way to determine whether a judiciary has the appropriate number of judges. But since doing a comparison between different countries with different legal systems and different cultures would be near impossible, “judges per population is a decent aggregate”, Kerkering said. He said the chief justice’s focus was on access to justice. “If there are not enough judges and the staff that support them then they are unable to provide the services that the judiciary requires. Case backlogs become one of the more obvious problems. Fewer judges mean that each judge is taking more cases.” “The more cases a judge has, the more time it takes to get through them. Access to justice requires timely decisions. The phrase ‘justice delayed is justice denied,’ is so commonly used for a reason. Often, as a case winds its way through the court system, avoidable delays result in long term harm.” “A judiciary that can’t get through its caseload promptly can’t ensure access to justice as required by the constitution.” Carlos Mureithi is a journalist based in Nairobi, Kenya Further reading: https://africacheck.org/reports/budget-cuts-hit-kenyas-judiciary-but-theres-no-global-funding-target/ Republish our content for free We believe that everyone needs the facts.

What's it mean for their taxes? Daniel de Visé USA TODAY During the 2020 presidential campaign, candidate Joe Biden presented voters with a bold pledge: He wouldn’t raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400,000 . President Biden has carried the same promise, and the same round sum, into his reelection campaign in 2024. If your income falls short of $400,000, you’re immune to tax hikes . If you earn more than that, your taxes may go up, and you just might be audited by the IRS . But a lot more people make $400,000 now than in 2020. Between 2019 and 2023, the number of American households earning more than $400,000 swelled by nearly half, from 2.6 million to an estimated 3.8 million out of roughly 131 million households. The figures come from census data compiled by the Economic Innovation Group , a public policy think tank based in Washington, D.C. Earnings are up for most Americans, both because of a strong economy and in response to rising consumer prices. Average hourly wages rose by more than one-fifth between January 2020 and April 2024, from $28.44 to $34.75, federal data show. Need a break?

If you adjust the figure for inflation , a $400,000 salary in January 2020 would be worth about $486,000 now. “Back then, $400,000 was a more notable number,” said Jonathan Swanburg , a certified financial planner in Houston. Perhaps it is too much to ask a candidate to apply a cost-of-living adjustment to a pithy campaign pledge. If Biden hit the trail in 2024 promising not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than $486,000, voters might react with puzzlement. And therein, some economists say, lies one of several problems with invoking an arbitrary figure when setting fiscal policy. “I think it’s kind of a ridiculous line to draw in the first place,” said Michael Strain , director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, another Washington think tank. “The threshold is not indexed to inflation, and it’s not indexed to average growth,” Strain said. “So, over time, more and more households are going to get hit by it.” Tax prep: 6 ways to file your taxes for free Biden administration officials say the $400,000 pledge was meant to signal his commitment not to raise taxes on anyone but the rich and his quest to ensure that the very rich don’t cheat on their taxes. “President Biden’s pledge not to raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 is a clear, direct and easy-to-understand commitment to the American people that, as long as he is president, he will not raise taxes on the middle class by one penny," said Jeremy M. Edwards, a White House spokesperson, adding that the president "will instead fight for a tax system that finally asks the wealthiest Americans and largest corporations to pay their fair share” Even now, over 95% of Americans earn less than $400,000 Biden officials note that, even now, well over 95% of American households earn less than $400,000. The $400,000 pledge sits well with advocates for progressive taxation, the principle of raising the tax rate for higher earners. “If you’re making $400,000, you’re wealthier than 97% of Americans, and your median net worth is $6.4 million,” said David Kass, executive director of the nonprofit Americans for Tax Fairness . “Obviously, these are folks who are doing well.” Republicans and Democrats alike are campaigning on protecting Americans from tax hikes. Republicans want to extend tax cuts enacted across the board by President Donald Trump in 2017. Democrats say they would protect all but the very wealthy. Both parties frustrate some economists, who say the government desperately needs new tax revenue to plug a yawning federal deficit, $1.7 trillion in 2023. “There’s this kind of myth out there that there’s disagreement between the parties over tax increases,” Strain said. “The reality is that one party, the Republicans, don’t want to raise taxes on anybody, and the other party, the Democrats, don’t want to raise taxes on 98% of the people, and that’s just a terrible situation to be in.” The Economic Innovation Group charted the growing ranks of Americans who earn $400,000 for The Wall Street Journal, which published the data in a story that asked whether the campaign pledge might ultimately backfire. That report focused on data from 2022. For this report, the think tank updated some of its figures through 2023. Many $400,000 households live in blue states According to the group’s research, two-thirds of the households that earned more than $400,000 in 2022 live in states Biden carried in 2020. These four states and the District of Columbia had the most families earning more than $400,000 in 2022: District of Columbia (6.1% of households earning at least $400,000) California (4.4%) Massachusetts (4.2%) New Jersey (4.1%) Connecticut (4%) The state with the fewest families above the $400,000 line, 0.8%, was Mississippi. Who earns $400,000 a year, anyway? A growing number of lucrative professions now pay $200,000 or even $300,000 a year, on average, based on federal data for 2023 . A few jobs pay $400,000.

Does it mean possible tax increases for a couple who earn $400,000 together, or only for an individual who earns that much alone? And is it gross income, or taxable income? Biden’s most recent budget raises the top income tax rate from 37% to 39.6% for single filers who make more than $400,000 in taxable income. For married couples, however, the bar rises to $450,000. More: The IRS is sending 125,000 compliance letters in campaign against wealthy tax cheats How does the $400,000 income threshold work with audits? And what about audits? Biden has pledged to raise billions of dollars in new revenue by going after wealthy tax cheats , again pledging not to target anyone earning less than $400,000. But does that cutoff for audits apply only to individual earners with $400,000 income, or to entire households? On that point, Biden’s pledge was “a little vague,” said one senior IRS official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to be quoted for attribution. Either way, the official said, a household with income of $400,000 or even $500,000 does not face a much higher risk of audit now than in years past. The most recent audit data, for tax year 2021, show an overall audit rate of 0.2%, or roughly one audit for every 500 returns from individual taxpayers. For returns that showed income of $500,000 to $1 million, the audit rate rose to 0.3%: one audit for every 333 returns.

Verdict One correct, one mostly correct, one misleading, two incorrect and two unproven. Source Wycliffe Oparanya, chair of Kenya’s council of governors (July 2020) This article is more than 4 years old Of the seven claims we checked, Oparanya was only correct that women are represented as required by law on county elected bodies. He was nearly on the money about the percentages allocated to health. His figures about allocations to agriculture didn’t add up, however. His claims about water and sanitation cannot be proven, while an expert told us that the 10% of budgets to be allocated to agriculture recommended by the African Union should be at both local and national levels of government, and not the sole responsibility of counties. While 2020 has been an uncertain year for many, Kenyan politicians remained predictable in at least one way: playing up their achievements in office. In November 2020 president Uhuru Kenyatta delivered a delayed state of the nation address, which we fact-checked . But three months earlier the country’s governors had braved the Covid-19 pandemic to make their annual state of devolution address . Delivered by Wycliffe Oparanya , the chair of the council of governors , the speech is required by law. Oparanya made a number of key claims, seven of which we fact-checked. These ranged from health and agriculture allocations to water and sanitation access. ( Note: Oparanya spoke on 23 July, three weeks into the new financial year. To effectively verify these claims, Africa Check waited for the office of the controller of budget ’s report on the previous financial year. This was published at the end of September. ) Claim Counties allocated an average of 7.3% of budgets to agriculture. Verdict incorrect Some of the data in the address was collected from the counties, the council’s communications office told Africa Check. They also referred us to the controller of budget’s report for the 2019/20 financial year. The report shows the 47 county governments approved a combined budget of KSh499.6 billion. We compiled data on what the counties allocated to their departments of agriculture. This was KSh34.4 billion, or 6.9% of their total budget. We therefore rate this claim as incorrect. Experts have also previously told us that actual spending is just as significant a measure to track. – Dancan Bwire Claim [The allocation to agriculture] is an increase of 0.6% from what was reported last year. Verdict incorrect In the 2019 state of devolution address , Oparanya gave the allocation to agriculture as 6.7%. We rated this claim as mostly correct as the average allocation was close enough, at 6.9%. A jump from 6.7% to 7.3% though is an increase of 0.6 percentage points or 8.9%. We therefore rate this as incorrect. ( Read our guide on how to avoid common statistical errors. ) – Alphonce Shiundu Claim [The counties are striving] to reach the 10% [allocation to agriculture] recommended by the Malabo declaration. Verdict misleading In 2014 the African Union met in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea’s capital city. The resulting Malabo declaration resolved to end hunger on the continent by 2025, and to ensure that “at least 10% of public expenditure” goes to agriculture. Dr Timothy Njagi is a research fellow at the Tegemeo Institute of Agriculture Policy and Development , an agriculture policy thinktank in Kenya. He has co-authored a policy brief urging county governments to invest more in agriculture and increase household incomes. The “correct computation” of the 10% target in the Malabo declaration “should be for the country”, he told Africa Check. This means total allocation and spending at both the national government and county government level. Njagi highlighted a 2017 report by the country’s planning department that showed what he called a “disturbing trend” where the majority of agriculture spending was concentrated at the national level. “For instance, between 2013 and 2017, 60% of the resources in agriculture were spent at the national level despite the majority of the functions being devolved,” he said. The report notes that counties consider their allocations and expenditure to agriculture to include aspects of cooperatives and trade, yet these do not constitute the sector as defined at the national level. In short, counties alone should not be chasing the 10% spending target. Therefore, we rate Oparanya’s claim as misleading. Njagi added that beyond allocation the money should be channelled to the “right uses”. He gave some of these as research, extension services and markets. -Alphonce Shiundu Claim Counties have over the past year sustained an average allocation of 24% of their total budgets to the health sector. Verdict mostly-correct In the 2019/20 financial year, Kenya’s counties allocated a combined KSh128.9 billion to health in their budgets. This is according to the controller of budget’s most recent report . As a share of their combined KSh499.6 billion budget, this works out to 25.8%. In 2019, Africa Check established the share of that year’s budget was 26%. Oparanya therefore understated his figure, but we rate the claim mostly correct. However, breaking down the data reveals some regional differences. Some 13 counties allocated less than 24% of their budgets to health. Taita Taveta had the lowest at 7%, while the highest was Kirinyaga at 40%. – Grace Gichuhi Claim Water coverage now stands at 63% from 57%. Verdict unproven Water coverage is the “population with access to water services, either with direct service connection or within reach of a public water point, as a percentage of the total population under utility’s nominal responsibility”. This definition is by the World Bank-funded International Benchmarking Network , a project that seeks to “support access to comparative information ... among water supply and sanitation providers worldwide”. In Kenya, water coverage is tracked by the Water Services Regulatory Board . It’s most recent report , published in 2020, covers the 2018/19 financial year. The data shows that water coverage improved from 57% in 2017/18 to 59% in 2018/19. In the absence of data for 2019/20, we rate council chair Oparanya’s claim unproven. The report also notes that water service providers serve barely half, or 49%, of the national population. “The trend in coverage has been growing, albeit slowly, with a growth of only four percentage points in the last five years,” it says. – Alphonce Shiundu Claim Sanitation coverage is now at 25%, from 16%. Verdict unproven The Water Services Regulatory Board defines “sewered sanitation coverage” as “the number of people served with flush or pour-flush to piped sewer systems, as a percentage of the total population within the service area of the utility”. Utilities with sewerage systems are measured on how they deliver sanitation services to their consumers. The board’s most recent report , published in 2020, covers the 2018/19 financial year. It shows that sanitation coverage increased slightly from 16% in 2017/18 to 17% in 2018/19. We however rate this claim as unproven as we do not have the board’s 2019/20 report that the governors referred to. The report does note there has been a decline in coverage as the population rose rapidly, outpacing investment in infrastructure. Only about 3.9 million people in 26 counties have access to sewered sanitation, it adds, with 61% of these people in the capital Nairobi. “This therefore implies that 21 counties lack any systems for waste management.” – Alphonce Shiundu Claim County governments have continued to adhere to the two-thirds gender principle. Three counties of Kilifi, Nyeri and Migori have gone higher and have a 50/50 representation of male and female CECs. Verdict correct “CECs” refer to county executive committee members who form the county cabinet. Kenya’s constitution prescribes that “not more than two-thirds of the members of elective or appointive bodies shall be of the same gender”. According to the most recent economic survey from the national statistics office, all 47 county assemblies have met this threshold since the last election in 2017. The survey’s data is sourced from the council of governors. For county executives, at least 30% of the county cabinets in 39 counties were female. The three counties cited by Oparanya, in addition to Mombasa, had achieved gender parity. Some counties that failed to achieve this included Kitui, which had no woman county executive in 2019, Nairobi and Kisumu (both 25%) and Kericho (16.7%). – Alphonce Shiundu Republish our content for free We believe that everyone needs the facts.

Traditionally, the continent has turned to small-scale community-based agricultural projects as a means to meet its food needs. But feeding a population of more than 1.2 billion people requires more than communal farming; it calls for a paradigm shift toward agriculture on an industrial scale. Our milestone tenth edition of Africa Focus opens with an article exploring obstacles to large-scale farming in Africa and how they may be overcome to secure funding required for such agricultural megaprojects. While Angola has entered an ambitious plan to diversify its economy, it remains heavily dependent on its oil & gas industry. Hydrocarbon revenues are crucial for funding Angola's commitments under the Paris Agreement, but also for diversifying the country's economy and improving the livelihoods of its citizens. Our second article looks at the latest developments in Angola's oil & gas sector, including increased M&A activity and a three-well offshore exploration project at a depth of 3,628 meters (11,903 feet) below mean sea level—a new world record water depth set in 2021. Africa is home to many of the world's most biodiverse regions, including eight of the 36 recognized global biodiversity hotspots. The Congo rainforests have also overtaken the Amazon as the most significant carbon sink on Earth. Our third article highlights the scale of the challenge of biodiversity protection in Africa and options to fund it. Trade ties between Africa and the United States are seeing something of a revival as the US seeks to revitalize its economic engagement on the continent. The US African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) is one such pivotal agreement that is due to go before the US Congress in 2025. Africa holds a remarkable 30 percent of the world's mineral reserves, yet it only accounted for less than 10 percent of global mining exploration spending and less than 5 percent of the sector's global revenue in 2022. Many of Africa's minerals are vital for reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to renewable energy. Developing these reserves sustainably is crucial for Africa's economies. Our final article examines how mining companies across Africa continue to find financing for the development of their projects.

But these challenges are not insurmountable: With agriculture at the core of the continent’s economic transformation, Africa has the potential to become a global agricultural powerhouse and a net exporter of food. Insight 12 July 2023 | 12 min read Gareth Hodder | Brenda Migwalla *Stephen Pickup, Head of Agriculture at Traditum Private Equity, co-authored this publication. US$1 trillion Africa’s food and agriculture market could increase from US$280 billion a year in 2023 to US$1 trillion by 2030 Africa has 60 percent of the world's uncultivated arable land. The agriculture sector accounts for 35 percent of Africa's GDP and employs more Africans than any other sector. So why does Africa spend a staggering US$78 billion of scarce foreign currency on food imports each year, with some countries such as Zimbabwe, Guinea and Sudan exceeding 100 percent of their annual foreign currency receipts? Why in 2020 did more than 20 percent of Africans face hunger—a figure twice as high as any other region in the world? Why is it that approximately 80 percent of the continent's food supply still comes from small-scale farmers, many still practicing subsistence agriculture? The 2030 Agenda adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on September 25, 2015, notes the need to "devote resources to developing rural areas and sustainable agriculture and fisheries…"; to "account for population trends in national, rural and urban development strategies and policies"; to "increase investment in rural infrastructure, agricultural research"; and to "support positive economic, social and environmental link between urban, peri-urban and rural areas". Agricultural aspirations for Africa are set out further by the African Union (AU) "Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want," which calls for accelerated agricultural growth and transformation, leading to shared prosperity and improved livelihoods. Although such global and pan-African statements of intent are crucial, they must be followed by concrete national regulations and policies if African agriculture is to attract the scale of investment required to become a net exporter of food. With agriculture at the core of Africa’s economic transformation, the continent has the potential to become a global agricultural powerhouse and a net exporter of food Among many other intricately interlinked challenges, Africa faces burgeoning cities and increasing numbers of rural mouths to feed. Between 1990 and 2021, the rural population of sub-Saharan Africa experienced a shift in both proportion and magnitude. While the percentage of the rural population decreased from 72 percent to 58 percent over the period, the actual number of rural residents increased significantly, surging from 374.5 million to 687 million. These challenges are not insurmountable, though. Africa has the potential to be a global agricultural powerhouse and a net exporter of food, with agriculture being a core driver of the continent's economic transformation. According to the African Development Bank, Africa's food and agriculture market could increase from US$280 billion a year in 2023 to US$1 trillion by 2030. But what would it take for Africa to emerge as a prominent global agricultural force? There are six levers that, when applied collectively, can trigger the agricultural renaissance in Africa that is necessary to achieve this vision. View full image: Six key levers that collectively can ignite Africa's agricultural renaissance (PDF) Shifting legislation and policies to support wider range of agricultural projects Impact investors being involved not only encourages new investors to come in, but they have capacity to support developers to bring about design improvements that commercial financial institutions cannot An African agricultural renaissance will require a shift in national development policies from supporting a small number of mostly export-focused crops—cotton, cocoa beans and coffee—to prioritizing a wider range of agricultural products for consumption on the continent. Agricultural exports are crucial, as they generate valuable foreign currency. A significant portion of Africa's cross-border trade is between African countries, which is also vital in fostering pan-African food security. In 2018, intra-African trade accounted for 15 percent of exports and, in turn, 15 percent of that was in agricultural products. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), established in that same year, will—in time—no doubt significantly enhance this flow of agricultural products across African borders. Improved customs processes at border crossings will help minimize the volume of produce spoiling in transit. Moreover, processing such exported goods locally rather than exporting raw products would increase revenues and create new job opportunities. Improving access to capital for private sector The COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc upon Africa's fiscal health, but it has not diminished the needs of the continent's agricultural sector or the urgency for them to be effectively met. Through the Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP), African Union member states committed to a minimum of 10 percent of their government expenditure toward agriculture. In 2021, however, the average government expenditure on agriculture in Africa stood at a mere 4.1 percent. Access to credit is a major impediment to private sector investment in African agriculture. According to the African Development Bank, the estimated current financing shortfall ranges between US$27 billion and US$65 billion annually. Even more direly, the Commercial Agriculture for Smallholders and Agribusiness (CASA) program—a flagship initiative of the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office—estimates the financing gap to be in excess of US$1 billion, based on the demand of US$160 billion, minus the current provision of US$54 billion by banks, impact investors and other financial intermediaries. US$78 billion Africa spends a staggering US$78 billion of scarce foreign currency on food imports each year Impact investors also play important roles. According to Philippa Viljoen of the impact investment firm InfraCo Africa, "Impact investors being involved not only encourages new investors to come in, but they have capacity to support developers to bring about design improvements that commercial financial institutions cannot. This can make the difference between a project being bankable, or not." The CASA report proposes four long-term strategies to bridge the funding gap: (i) grow more small agribusinesses into commercially viable projects to anchor local bank financing; (ii) develop capacity, incentives and infrastructure for local banks and funds to profitably support smaller, less commercial agribusinesses; (iii) enhance the effectiveness of blended finance instruments; and (iv) build infrastructure around climate finance. These strategies are enormous both in scope and in scale. Transforming them into tangible reality will depend heavily on coordinated action from stakeholders within the agricultural finance ecosystem. Small-scale agricultural operations have very direct links to community upliftment. With the appropriate institutional and advisory support and compelling business cases, such projects offer viable opportunities for sustainable finance instruments such as social bonds and loans, blended finance and impact investing, and can become attractive investment options for institutional investors. Within Africa's agriculture and food & beverage sectors, there are currently 56 companies with annual revenues above US$500 million, of which 14 companies have turnovers in excess of US$1 billion. Such larger-scale agro-industrial enterprises are better placed to attract their own capital, and their future seems bright. Some of the world's largest agriculture companies—including the three biggest players, Cargill, ADM and Bayer—also have significant operations in Africa. View full image: Africa’s largest indigenous companies with US$500+ million annual revenues in agriculture & food chain (PDF) Addressing the infrastructure gap 4.1% In 2021, the average government expenditure on agriculture in Africa stood at a mere 4.1 percent The infrastructure gap in Africa is well documented, and it impacts agriculture as significantly as it does other sectors. The reliance on outdated, poorly maintained—or even nonexistent—infrastructure inhibits productivity at least as much as other institutional challenges, such as weak governance, onerous regulation and lack of access to finance. Poor road, rail and harbor infrastructure hinders farmers from being able to get their goods to market, and add as much as 30 to 40 percent to the costs of goods traded among African countries. While investment in African infrastructure projects has seen a general increase in recent decades, the reality remains that fewer than 10 percent of infrastructure projects in Africa reach financial close, with 80 percent failing at the feasibility and business plan stage. Lack of clarity about the commercial viability, political and currency risk, counterparty and regulatory risk, and lack of exit opportunities are all factors in such a high rate of failure. Involvement of credible development finance institutions provides assurance that due diligence has been rigorous and the overall approach prudent, which enhances the probability of closure, and proper risk mitigation instruments help improve the credit rating of the borrower, hence the cost of finance. View full image: Modern commercial agriculture, at scale in Africa, will require enhancement of all aspects of the value c (PDF) Resolving supply chain issues 30-40% Additional cost to goods traded between African countries because of poor road, rail and harbor infrastructure Supply chain costs and related issues are a major obstacle to the renaissance of African agriculture. Making food supply chains more efficient and profitable requires reliable and efficient delivery of upstream goods and services, as well as downstream delivery of the goods to market. One notable example is Releaf, a Lagos-based company that uses cutting-edge technologies, including geospatial mapping, to identify optimal locations for supply chain infrastructure and to bring processing capacity directly to palm nut farmers in Nigeria, eliminating the need for these farmers to rely on large factories, located too far away to be affordably reached. Rent-seeking by third parties—which can sometimes extend to corruption—can increase the costs of doing business, both upstream and downstream, and discourage investment into African agriculture projects. While regulatory reform and institutional enhancement will help reduce such practices, some large-scale farming enterprises have resorted to resolving this challenge through vertical integration of upstream and downstream supply chain components into their own businesses, rather than relying on external parties. The emergence of large-scale supermarket chains working directly with their suppliers to improve supply chain efficiencies is also helping to alleviate some of the downstream challenges. Improving productivity of small-scale farmers US$ 1,526 The agricultural value added per farmworker in sub-Saharan Africa was a mere US$1,526 in 2019, in stark contrast with that of a US farmworker, which exceeded US$100,000 Small-scale farmers will remain crucial to African agriculture for years to come, but they are facing significant pressures. Both small- and medium-scale farming enterprises are focusing almost exclusively on markets immediately local to them. These farmers need better access to irrigation and technology to improve their productivity and farming practices. Small-scale farmers also need support in storing and transporting their produce to market. Centralized entities that are properly managed—rather than individual farmers themselves—would be far better positioned to attract funding and deliver results. View full image: Agriculture value added per worker 1991 to 2019, projected to current (PDF) Adapting to climate change 30 million tons of cereals have been displaced in Africa due to the situation in Ukraine Adapting Africa's food systems to climate change is an imperative, not a choice. If global temperatures rise by 2° to 3° Celsius above pre-industrial levels, as current trends suggest, disruption to African food security will be profound—potentially catastrophic—for those already struggling with hunger. Even on the 1.5° Celsius trajectory proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a maximum, more ambitious and innovative adaptation interventions are needed to avoid widespread famine and forced migration in coming decades. Research and planning are required to assess how Africa's food security is to be achieved amid diminished agricultural potential, particularly in the face of water scarcity. From self-sufficiency to global food powerhouse Russia's invasion of Ukraine has had a devastating impact on Africa's food security, and has triggered a shortage of at least 30 million tons of food across the continent, especially wheat, maize and soybeans. Just replacing the 30 million tons of cereals that have been displaced due to the situation in Ukraine means approximately 36,000 square kilometers of farmland would be needed if Africa were to achieve the same cereal yield of 8.27 tons per hectare as in the United States. However, at Africa's current cereal yield of 1.75 tons per hectare, the required farmland would exceed a staggering 171,000 square kilometers. Improving yield is a key priority. Enabling Africa to feed itself and realize its potential of becoming a global agricultural powerhouse requires development of large-scale commercial farming using cutting-edge technologies. It also requires effective support to small-scale farmers to enhance their production and competitiveness in the market. These need not be conflicting priorities. The challenges are significant but not insurmountable. This implies mechanization on a grand scale. In 2019, the agricultural value added per farmworker in the US exceeded US$100,000. In sub-Saharan Africa, it amounted to a mere US$1,526. Over the past three decades, Africa tripled its cereal production. But its yield barely increased, with almost all the growth resulting from the expansion of cultivation areas. This stands in stark contrast to Southeast Asia, which has also significantly increased its cereal output, but the gains have been almost entirely through yield improvement. Significant improvements in productivity will also benefit Africa's biodiversity, as it will reduce the need to cultivate vast tracts of virgin land in order to meet the continent's demands. A comprehensive overhaul of both upstream and downstream supply chains will be necessary to add tens or hundreds of millions of tons of new cereal production in Africa. Infrastructure will need to be improved to the point at which seed, fertilizer, equipment and other production necessities can be transported to farms. Ideally, these agricultural necessities should be manufactured in Africa, requiring the construction of new factories with their own supply chains. Downstream, infrastructure bottlenecks must be cleared to facilitate commerce and distribution, establish new agro-processing plants and create new wholesale and retail businesses. The debt raised to finance African agricultural projects can be serviced through the reduction in expenditures currently allocated to food imports. Since demand for food is perennial, strong business cases are possible if the structural impediments to production can be overcome. Investment in agrifoodtech saw a 44 percent decline globally from 2021 to 2022. Not so in Africa, where it has grown substantially in recent years, from US$185 million in 2020 to US$482.3 million in 2021, and to US$640 million in 2022. However, this investment represents less than 1 percent of the total amount spent on imported food. View full image: Amount of long-leased (typically to foreign entities) as a percentage of all arable land (PDF) In addition to overcoming structural obstacles to production, planning needs to be pragmatic, focusing on large-scale agrifood projects, developing bankable business cases and managing investment risks to create an environment attractive to private sector investors. Governments have a crucial role to play in this by taking responsibility for the creation of a regulatory environment supportive of a substantially expanded agricultural sector in Africa. The shift toward large-scale agriculture, however, must not come at the expense of small-scale farmers, who are an integral part of Africa's agricultural landscape. There has never been a more opportune moment for a fundamental shift in Africa's agricultural sector. Africa should be able to feed itself with its locally produced food; it should also be contributing significantly to feeding the world.

Africa has a bold plan for agriculture: now is the time to implement it African leaders have committed to decisive steps to address food insecurity, but implementation is essential, says Nardos Bekele-Thomas. February 10th, 2025 Opinion by Nardos Bekele-Thomas Image : TONY KARUMBA/AFP Africa’s food sector is at a crossroads. A new continental vision for building resilient and sustainable agrifood systems – the Kampala Declaration – was agreed at an African Union summit of heads of state held in Kampala, Uganda from 9 th to 11 th of January 2025. The summit endorsed a new 10-year Strategy of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) for 2026 to 2035. Through the Kampala Declaration, our African leaders committed to take decisive action to address perennial challenges that have led to food insecurity, environmental degradation, high dependence on food imports, vulnerability to climatic and socio-economic shocks, and marginalisation of key groups such as women and youths in our continent. The Declaration is an ambitious agenda to increase food output by 45%, reduce post-harvest losses by half, and raise the share of locally processed food to 35% of the agrifood sector GDP by the end of 2035. To drive this growth, our leaders in Africa have committed to mobilising a total of $100bn in public and private sector investment and financing in the next 10 years. These interventions are intended to end hunger and reduce malnutrition by 25%, boost intra-African trade, advance inclusivity and equitable livelihoods, and protect at least 40% of households from shocks in the next 10 years. The African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD) as the premier development agency for the African Union (AU), has been mandated to lead the implementation of the Kampala Declaration. This role will include supporting AU member states to domesticate this continental agenda and align it with their own national development plans and budget frameworks. Together with my team we will also support and coordinate member states and other key stakeholders in the execution of priority programmes, partnership building, resources mobilisation, knowledge exchange and monitoring and reporting of progress towards the targets. Urgent need to accelerate implementation Although this is a role that AUDA-NEPAD has been playing since the inception of the CAADP programme in 2003, the urgent need to accelerate implementation and align with the new Kampala agenda means that we will need to rapidly expand our technical and financial resources to support the execution of the CAADP Kampala agenda. Discussions with key partnerships such as knowledge partners, non-governmental Organisations, private players, farmers representatives, civil society organisations and donor agencies are already under ways to expand existing partners or to build new one required to support the new CAADP agenda. The Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) has been a pivotal framework for transforming agriculture across Africa since its inception in 2003 with the Maputo Declaration. In 2014, the African heads of state and government reaffirmed their commitment to the CAADP agenda through the Maputo declaration, agreeing to allocate at least 10% of public expenditure to agriculture to achieve a 6% annual growth rate in agricultural gross domestic product (GDP). The 2014 Malabo CAADP Declaration reinforced these commitments and added more ambitious goals and targets to be achieved by 2025, including eradicating hunger, halving poverty, tripling intra-African agricultural trade and building resilience. CAADP has been perhaps one of AU’s most consequential and far-reaching policy framework. Adopted by nearly all AU member states, CAADP has led the development of robust agricultural transformation policies and plans. After two decades of CAADP implementation, Africa is in a remarkably better position than at the time of the Maputo declaration in 2003. The continent has made enormous progress in terms of economic and agricultural growth, improvement in poverty and nutrition outcomes, expansion of agricultural trade, and public investments in agriculture. Agricultural public investment has risen to double the levels seen in the 1990s. Increasing investment in agriculture as a driver of transformation is foremost among the objectives of CAADP. In absolute terms, public expenditure on agriculture (PAE) increased from $10.7bn in 2000 to $17bn in 2021. CAADP commitment to triple intra-continental trade in agricultural commodities has contributed to robust growth in intra-regional and global agricultural trade. Between 2003 and 2021, the value of intra-African agricultural trade increased by 175% from $5.4bn to $14.9bn. Currently around 20% of Africa’s agricultural exports are directed within the continent. Africa’s global agricultural exports also increased significantly from $25.3bn in 2003 to $73.2bn in 2021. From Malabo to the Kampala Declaration Despite significant achievements, which we thank our partners and stakeholders for, from CAADP implementation in the last 20 years, progress measured against the Malabo targets has been insufficient as revealed by the four biennial review reports presented so far – including the fourth iteration that was presented to the AU Assembly in February 2024. The heads of state and government acknowledged that the continent is not on track to meet the Malabo goals and targets by 2025, underscoring the urgency to develop a post-Malabo CAADP agenda focused on building resilient, inclusive and sustainable agrifood systems over the next CAADP decade (2026-2035). The roadmap to develop a post-Malabo agenda was launched in March 2024. The African Union Commission (AUC), through its Department of Agriculture, Rural Development, Blue Economy and Sustainable Environment (DARBE) and the African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD), in collaboration with key technical partners, initiated the process. The roadmap emphasised broad and inclusive stakeholder consultations and thematic analytical studies that involved African and international centres of excellence, state and non-state stakeholders and representatives on farmers. The new CAADP Strategy and Action Plan (2026-2035) envisions sustainable and resilient agrifood systems for a healthy and prosperous Africa. In line with Agenda 2063, the African Common Position on Food Systems and the COP28 commitments on food systems, it advocates for transformative, holistic approaches that span the entire agrifood value chain, from production to consumption. The strategy integrates economic, social and environmental dimensions to enhance food security, improve nutrition and promote agricultural sustainability, while focusing on strengthening institutional capacity, harnessing technology and diversifying economies through value-added activities and agro-industrialisation that create jobs and improve livelihoods. Guided by the principles of national ownership, inclusiveness, environmental sustainability and multi-stakeholder coordination, the plan emphasises evidence-based decision-making, mutual accountability and regional cooperation to harness synergies across the continent. Through this integrated framework, CAADP aims to accelerate the transformation of agrifood systems while ensuring equitable benefits for all stakeholders, especially women, youth and vulnerable groups. Six strategic objectives The 10-year strategy is organised into six S trategic Objective areas which outline priority intervention areas needed to drive the transformation of agrifood systems – intensifying sustainable food production, agro-industrialisation, and trade; boosting investment and financing for transformation; ensuring food and nutrition security; advancing inclusivity and equitable livelihoods; building resilient agrifood systems; and strengthening agrifood systems governance. While the Kampala Declaration is a new vision for Africa’s agrifood systems transformation, it largely builds on the lessons and achievements of the Malabo Declaration. Lessons from 20 years of CAADP implementation shape both the approach and substance of the Kampala Declaration and its 10-year Strategy. The Kampala Declaration is premised on the urgent need to accelerate implementation while ensuring continuity, coherence and consistence in the continental agrifood systems agenda. To ensure the successful implementation of the post-Malabo CAADP agenda, strengthening institutional and human capacities is essential. This includes targeted support to us at AUDA-NEPAD and other AU institutions who have been mandated with leading and coordinating the implementation of Kampala Declaration. A proposed special fund is intended to mobilise significant resources to support implementation at scale. Improving knowledge management and accountability mechanisms is equally critical. AUDA-NEPAD its partners will pursue the work to strengthen mutual accountability frameworks and enhancing reporting systems, such as the CAADP biennial review process, to enable better tracking of progress and alignment with the agenda’s objectives. These systems will ensure that data-driven insights inform policies and interventions, fostering transparency and building trust among diverse stakeholders. Follow the roadmap At AUDA-NEPAD, we have begun the process of developing a roadmap for the domestication of the Kampala Declaration. The roadmap will outline all key steps to be followed, and the main actions involved. To ensure continuity and sustained momentum, the work of engaging with member states to plan for the technical support and coordination required to drive the domestication of the Kampala Declaration at national level continues. We are pleased that some of the member states have already submitted requests to AUDA-NEPAD for support in revising and reviewing their national agricultural investment plans (NAIPs) to better align with the Kampala Agenda. Preparations are also underway to review existing mutual accountability frameworks such as the Biennial Review process in line recommendations made in the new CAADP Strategy and Action Plan (2026-2035). The year 2025 is a time for transition and acceleration as we turn the page on Malabo and open a new chapter of the Kampala CAADP agenda. Want to continue reading? Subscribe today.

Verdict Four correct, one understated and one unproven Source Kenya’s chief justice, David Maraga (August 2020) This article is more than 4 years old Maraga was largely correct about the judiciary budget and how many Kenyans are served per judge and magistrate in the country. The chief justice was also correct that the number of cases filed in Kenyan courts every year exceeds the number of cases the judiciary settles by as much as 100,000, causing an ever-growing backlog. But there isn’t evidence of a global average for comparing the number of judges and magistrates per population – there are too many variables in different legal systems. To mark the tenth anniversary of Kenya’s constitution , broadcaster NTV interviewed current and former government officials on how the law has been applied. Chief justice David Maraga told NTV that while the 2010 constitution had sought to strengthen the judiciary’s independence, funding was a perennial headache. “[Budget cuts] hit the judiciary sometimes to a point that its operations grind to a halt,” Maraga said in the interview , published in August 2020. In recent months the chief justice has been vocal on how cuts have hampered the delivery of judicial services. In his interview, Maraga made several claims. We looked into their accuracy. Claim The judiciary does not even get 1% of the national budget Verdict correct Maraga, who assumed office in 2016, asked for more funding as “the judiciary does not even get 1% of the national budget”. “We have said, over and over again, that for the judiciary to operate properly we should get at least 2.5% of the national budget,” he said . Africa Check has previously found there isn’t a “recommended global percentage” of funding for the judiciary from the national budget. In 2018 Maraga also claimed it was 2.5%. To determine how much has been allocated to the judiciary in recent years we consulted the appropriation acts, the laws that show budget allocations to government departments. For the national budget, we checked budget statements. Judiciary amounts as share of Kenya budget Year Judiciary budget (KSh billion) National budget (KSh trillion) Share 2014/15 17.5 1.58 1.1% 2015/16 16.7 2 0.8% 2016/17 17.3 2.3 0.8% 2017/18 17.6 2.3 0.8% 2018/19 14.5 2.6 0.6% 2019/20 18.9 2.8 0.7% 2020/21 17.4 2.8 0.6% Sources: Budget speeches for 2020 , 2019 , 2018 , 2017 , 2016 , 2015 and 2014 and Appropriations Acts for 2020, 2019 , 2018 , 2017 , 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . Note: The figures shown have been rounded up. Only once in the last seven financial years, in 2014/15, did the judiciary receive more than 1% of the national budget. We therefore rate this claim as correct. Claim We have an average of 400,000 cases being filed in our courts every year Verdict correct The most recent state of the judiciary report covers the 2018/19 financial year. Released in January 2020, it shows that more than two million cases were lodged in all courts between 2014/15 and 2018/19. The report said : “The number of filed cases provides quantitative information on the extent of demand for court services by the public.” Total number of cases filed in the judiciary Financial year Cases 2014/15 334,685 2015/16 460,961 2016/17 344,180 2017/18 402,243 2018/19 484,349 Average 405,283 The average number of cases filed in the period covered by the report works out to 405,283 a year. We therefore rate this claim as correct. Claim We only dispose of about 300,000 cases Verdict correct Discussing the country’s case backlog, Maraga said the judiciary settles about 300,000 cases every year. This number was determined by the number of judges and magistrates and would only continue to pile up. “Unless the judiciary is given enough resources to have enough manpower, Kenyans will continue crying about delayed cases,” he said . The most recent state of the judiciary report has data covering 2014/15 to 2018/19. It shows an average of 321,652 cases settled across the five financial years. As of 2018/19 there were 153 judges and 546 magistrates in Kenya. Number of cases resolved by the judiciary Financial year Cases 2014/15 272,605 2015/16 191,625 2016/17 304,182 2017/18 370,488 2018/19 469,359 Average 321,652 We therefore rate the claim as correct. Claim In Kenya now with a population of about 48 million, we have one judge serving over 300,000 people Verdict correct There are 47.6 million people in Kenya, according to 2019 census data. The most recent data from the judiciary shows there were 153 judges as of June 2019. This works out to one judge for every 311,000 people. We rate this claim as correct. Claim We have one magistrate serving over 77,000 people Verdict understated The most recent data from the judiciary shows there were 546 magistrates in Kenya as of June 2019. The state of the judiciary report was released in January 2020. Using a population of 47.6 million , this works out to one magistrate for every 87,114 people. The chief justice’s figure was off by over 10,000 but it was still “over 77,000” people per magistrate. We therefore rate it as understated. Claim There is a ‘global average’ for the number of judges and magistrates to number of people Verdict unproven A calculation for a “global average” can be achieved by directly comparing the number of judges and magistrates to the world population. But to account for population differences, rates (per 100,000 people) are widely used . ( Note: See box below for more context. ) The chief justice has in the past spoken of a “recommended global percentage” of funding for the judiciary. We have contacted the judiciary for the source of the "global average" cited by the chief justice and will update this report with their response. Wachira Maina is a constitutional lawyer in Kenya who has written about the progress of institutions, including the judiciary, following the adoption of the 2010 constitution. He directed us to the UN Office of Drug and Crime (UNODC) for data on the administration of justice professionals against a country’s population. It shows there were 1.3 judges or magistrates for every 100,000 people in Kenya in 2014, 3.6 for South Africa in 2015, and 0.8 for the US and 8.7 for China in 2017. But the UNODC noted key weaknesses in the data when comparing countries. “The numbers reported are not restricted to judges deciding criminal cases,” it said. “The comparability problem might get even worse because some countries might still only report the number of judges whose duty is the judgment of criminal cases. “Apart from this, it is not clear whether really all judges are included in the reported figures in all countries.” Without a source for the chief justice’s claim of a global average, we can only rate this final claim as unproven. Is calculating the ratio of judges and magistrates to the population useful? The ratio of judges and magistrates to the population is useful depending on what you’re using it to show, Wachira Maina , a constitutional lawyer in Kenya told Africa Check. He gave an example of using the ratio of the number of doctors to the population as a metric for access to health, and of police officers to measure access to security services. However, he said, ratio data leaves a lot unstated, such as the distribution by region and by urban and rural areas. Therefore “to determine access to services, you will almost certainly need additional information”. “A high ratio by itself does not prove that most people have access to services, merely that if services were equitably distributed, and they rarely are, more people would have access,” Maina said. “Keep in mind though that you cannot increase access unless you have the numbers, so the ratio does still say something useful.” Chris Kerkering is a litigation manager at Katiba Institute , an organisation in Nairobi that promotes the knowledge of Kenya’s constitution. He told Africa Check that population does not automatically equate to a judge’s caseload. A very litigious society would have more cases per population, he said. Caseload and caseload weighting, which Kerkering described as not only counting the number of cases but also being able to determine how much time each respective case would take , may be the best way to determine whether a judiciary has the appropriate number of judges. But since doing a comparison between different countries with different legal systems and different cultures would be near impossible, “judges per population is a decent aggregate”, Kerkering said. He said the chief justice’s focus was on access to justice. “If there are not enough judges and the staff that support them then they are unable to provide the services that the judiciary requires. Case backlogs become one of the more obvious problems. Fewer judges mean that each judge is taking more cases.” “The more cases a judge has, the more time it takes to get through them. Access to justice requires timely decisions. The phrase ‘justice delayed is justice denied,’ is so commonly used for a reason. Often, as a case winds its way through the court system, avoidable delays result in long term harm.” “A judiciary that can’t get through its caseload promptly can’t ensure access to justice as required by the constitution.” Carlos Mureithi is a journalist based in Nairobi, Kenya Further reading: https://africacheck.org/reports/budget-cuts-hit-kenyas-judiciary-but-theres-no-global-funding-target/ Republish our content for free We believe that everyone needs the facts.

Verdict Four correct, one understated and one unproven Source Kenya’s chief justice, David Maraga (August 2020) This article is more than 4 years old Maraga was largely correct about the judiciary budget and how many Kenyans are served per judge and magistrate in the country. The chief justice was also correct that the number of cases filed in Kenyan courts every year exceeds the number of cases the judiciary settles by as much as 100,000, causing an ever-growing backlog. But there isn’t evidence of a global average for comparing the number of judges and magistrates per population – there are too many variables in different legal systems. To mark the tenth anniversary of Kenya’s constitution , broadcaster NTV interviewed current and former government officials on how the law has been applied. Chief justice David Maraga told NTV that while the 2010 constitution had sought to strengthen the judiciary’s independence, funding was a perennial headache. “[Budget cuts] hit the judiciary sometimes to a point that its operations grind to a halt,” Maraga said in the interview , published in August 2020. In recent months the chief justice has been vocal on how cuts have hampered the delivery of judicial services. In his interview, Maraga made several claims. We looked into their accuracy. Claim The judiciary does not even get 1% of the national budget Verdict correct Maraga, who assumed office in 2016, asked for more funding as “the judiciary does not even get 1% of the national budget”. “We have said, over and over again, that for the judiciary to operate properly we should get at least 2.5% of the national budget,” he said . Africa Check has previously found there isn’t a “recommended global percentage” of funding for the judiciary from the national budget. In 2018 Maraga also claimed it was 2.5%. To determine how much has been allocated to the judiciary in recent years we consulted the appropriation acts, the laws that show budget allocations to government departments. For the national budget, we checked budget statements.

Verdict Four correct, one understated and one unproven Source Kenya’s chief justice, David Maraga (August 2020) This article is more than 4 years old Maraga was largely correct about the judiciary budget and how many Kenyans are served per judge and magistrate in the country. The chief justice was also correct that the number of cases filed in Kenyan courts every year exceeds the number of cases the judiciary settles by as much as 100,000, causing an ever-growing backlog. But there isn’t evidence of a global average for comparing the number of judges and magistrates per population – there are too many variables in different legal systems. To mark the tenth anniversary of Kenya’s constitution , broadcaster NTV interviewed current and former government officials on how the law has been applied. Chief justice David Maraga told NTV that while the 2010 constitution had sought to strengthen the judiciary’s independence, funding was a perennial headache. “[Budget cuts] hit the judiciary sometimes to a point that its operations grind to a halt,” Maraga said in the interview , published in August 2020. In recent months the chief justice has been vocal on how cuts have hampered the delivery of judicial services. In his interview, Maraga made several claims. We looked into their accuracy. Claim The judiciary does not even get 1% of the national budget Verdict correct Maraga, who assumed office in 2016, asked for more funding as “the judiciary does not even get 1% of the national budget”. “We have said, over and over again, that for the judiciary to operate properly we should get at least 2.5% of the national budget,” he said . Africa Check has previously found there isn’t a “recommended global percentage” of funding for the judiciary from the national budget. In 2018 Maraga also claimed it was 2.5%. To determine how much has been allocated to the judiciary in recent years we consulted the appropriation acts, the laws that show budget allocations to government departments. For the national budget, we checked budget statements. Judiciary amounts as share of Kenya budget Year Judiciary budget (KSh billion) National budget (KSh trillion) Share 2014/15 17.5 1.58 1.1% 2015/16 16.7 2 0.8% 2016/17 17.3 2.3 0.8% 2017/18 17.6 2.3 0.8% 2018/19 14.5 2.6 0.6% 2019/20 18.9 2.8 0.7% 2020/21 17.4 2.8 0.6% Sources: Budget speeches for 2020 , 2019 , 2018 , 2017 , 2016 , 2015 and 2014 and Appropriations Acts for 2020, 2019 , 2018 , 2017 , 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . Note: The figures shown have been rounded up. Only once in the last seven financial years, in 2014/15, did the judiciary receive more than 1% of the national budget. We therefore rate this claim as correct. Claim We have an average of 400,000 cases being filed in our courts every year Verdict correct The most recent state of the judiciary report covers the 2018/19 financial year. Released in January 2020, it shows that more than two million cases were lodged in all courts between 2014/15 and 2018/19. The report said : “The number of filed cases provides quantitative information on the extent of demand for court services by the public.” Total number of cases filed in the judiciary Financial year Cases 2014/15 334,685 2015/16 460,961 2016/17 344,180 2017/18 402,243 2018/19 484,349 Average 405,283 The average number of cases filed in the period covered by the report works out to 405,283 a year. We therefore rate this claim as correct. Claim We only dispose of about 300,000 cases Verdict correct Discussing the country’s case backlog, Maraga said the judiciary settles about 300,000 cases every year. This number was determined by the number of judges and magistrates and would only continue to pile up. “Unless the judiciary is given enough resources to have enough manpower, Kenyans will continue crying about delayed cases,” he said . The most recent state of the judiciary report has data covering 2014/15 to 2018/19. It shows an average of 321,652 cases settled across the five financial years. As of 2018/19 there were 153 judges and 546 magistrates in Kenya. Number of cases resolved by the judiciary Financial year Cases 2014/15 272,605 2015/16 191,625 2016/17 304,182 2017/18 370,488 2018/19 469,359 Average 321,652 We therefore rate the claim as correct. Claim In Kenya now with a population of about 48 million, we have one judge serving over 300,000 people Verdict correct There are 47.6 million people in Kenya, according to 2019 census data. The most recent data from the judiciary shows there were 153 judges as of June 2019. This works out to one judge for every 311,000 people. We rate this claim as correct. Claim We have one magistrate serving over 77,000 people Verdict understated The most recent data from the judiciary shows there were 546 magistrates in Kenya as of June 2019. The state of the judiciary report was released in January 2020. Using a population of 47.6 million , this works out to one magistrate for every 87,114 people. The chief justice’s figure was off by over 10,000 but it was still “over 77,000” people per magistrate. We therefore rate it as understated. Claim There is a ‘global average’ for the number of judges and magistrates to number of people Verdict unproven A calculation for a “global average” can be achieved by directly comparing the number of judges and magistrates to the world population. But to account for population differences, rates (per 100,000 people) are widely used . ( Note: See box below for more context. ) The chief justice has in the past spoken of a “recommended global percentage” of funding for the judiciary. We have contacted the judiciary for the source of the "global average" cited by the chief justice and will update this report with their response. Wachira Maina is a constitutional lawyer in Kenya who has written about the progress of institutions, including the judiciary, following the adoption of the 2010 constitution. He directed us to the UN Office of Drug and Crime (UNODC) for data on the administration of justice professionals against a country’s population. It shows there were 1.3 judges or magistrates for every 100,000 people in Kenya in 2014, 3.6 for South Africa in 2015, and 0.8 for the US and 8.7 for China in 2017. But the UNODC noted key weaknesses in the data when comparing countries. “The numbers reported are not restricted to judges deciding criminal cases,” it said. “The comparability problem might get even worse because some countries might still only report the number of judges whose duty is the judgment of criminal cases. “Apart from this, it is not clear whether really all judges are included in the reported figures in all countries.” Without a source for the chief justice’s claim of a global average, we can only rate this final claim as unproven. Is calculating the ratio of judges and magistrates to the population useful? The ratio of judges and magistrates to the population is useful depending on what you’re using it to show, Wachira Maina , a constitutional lawyer in Kenya told Africa Check. He gave an example of using the ratio of the number of doctors to the population as a metric for access to health, and of police officers to measure access to security services. However, he said, ratio data leaves a lot unstated, such as the distribution by region and by urban and rural areas. Therefore “to determine access to services, you will almost certainly need additional information”. “A high ratio by itself does not prove that most people have access to services, merely that if services were equitably distributed, and they rarely are, more people would have access,” Maina said. “Keep in mind though that you cannot increase access unless you have the numbers, so the ratio does still say something useful.” Chris Kerkering is a litigation manager at Katiba Institute , an organisation in Nairobi that promotes the knowledge of Kenya’s constitution. He told Africa Check that population does not automatically equate to a judge’s caseload. A very litigious society would have more cases per population, he said. Caseload and caseload weighting, which Kerkering described as not only counting the number of cases but also being able to determine how much time each respective case would take , may be the best way to determine whether a judiciary has the appropriate number of judges. But since doing a comparison between different countries with different legal systems and different cultures would be near impossible, “judges per population is a decent aggregate”, Kerkering said. He said the chief justice’s focus was on access to justice. “If there are not enough judges and the staff that support them then they are unable to provide the services that the judiciary requires. Case backlogs become one of the more obvious problems. Fewer judges mean that each judge is taking more cases.” “The more cases a judge has, the more time it takes to get through them. Access to justice requires timely decisions. The phrase ‘justice delayed is justice denied,’ is so commonly used for a reason. Often, as a case winds its way through the court system, avoidable delays result in long term harm.” “A judiciary that can’t get through its caseload promptly can’t ensure access to justice as required by the constitution.” Carlos Mureithi is a journalist based in Nairobi, Kenya Further reading: https://africacheck.org/reports/budget-cuts-hit-kenyas-judiciary-but-theres-no-global-funding-target/ Republish our content for free We believe that everyone needs the facts.

Judiciary amounts as share of Kenya budget Year Judiciary budget (KSh billion) National budget (KSh trillion) Share 2014/15 17.5 1.58 1.1% 2015/16 16.7 2 0.8% 2016/17 17.3 2.3 0.8% 2017/18 17.6 2.3 0.8% 2018/19 14.5 2.6 0.6% 2019/20 18.9 2.8 0.7% 2020/21 17.4 2.8 0.6% Sources: Budget speeches for 2020 , 2019 , 2018 , 2017 , 2016 , 2015 and 2014 and Appropriations Acts for 2020, 2019 , 2018 , 2017 , 2016 , 2015 and 2014 . Note: The figures shown have been rounded up. Only once in the last seven financial years, in 2014/15, did the judiciary receive more than 1% of the national budget. We therefore rate this claim as correct. Claim We have an average of 400,000 cases being filed in our courts every year Verdict correct The most recent state of the judiciary report covers the 2018/19 financial year. Released in January 2020, it shows that more than two million cases were lodged in all courts between 2014/15 and 2018/19. The report said : “The number of filed cases provides quantitative information on the extent of demand for court services by the public.” Total number of cases filed in the judiciary Financial year Cases 2014/15 334,685 2015/16 460,961 2016/17 344,180 2017/18 402,243 2018/19 484,349 Average 405,283 The average number of cases filed in the period covered by the report works out to 405,283 a year. We therefore rate this claim as correct. Claim We only dispose of about 300,000 cases Verdict correct Discussing the country’s case backlog, Maraga said the judiciary settles about 300,000 cases every year. This number was determined by the number of judges and magistrates and would only continue to pile up. “Unless the judiciary is given enough resources to have enough manpower, Kenyans will continue crying about delayed cases,” he said . The most recent state of the judiciary report has data covering 2014/15 to 2018/19. It shows an average of 321,652 cases settled across the five financial years. As of 2018/19 there were 153 judges and 546 magistrates in Kenya. Number of cases resolved by the judiciary Financial year Cases 2014/15 272,605 2015/16 191,625 2016/17 304,182 2017/18 370,488 2018/19 469,359 Average 321,652 We therefore rate the claim as correct. Claim In Kenya now with a population of about 48 million, we have one judge serving over 300,000 people Verdict correct There are 47.6 million people in Kenya, according to 2019 census data. The most recent data from the judiciary shows there were 153 judges as of June 2019. This works out to one judge for every 311,000 people. We rate this claim as correct. Claim We have one magistrate serving over 77,000 people Verdict understated The most recent data from the judiciary shows there were 546 magistrates in Kenya as of June 2019. The state of the judiciary report was released in January 2020. Using a population of 47.6 million , this works out to one magistrate for every 87,114 people. The chief justice’s figure was off by over 10,000 but it was still “over 77,000” people per magistrate. We therefore rate it as understated. Claim There is a ‘global average’ for the number of judges and magistrates to number of people Verdict unproven A calculation for a “global average” can be achieved by directly comparing the number of judges and magistrates to the world population. But to account for population differences, rates (per 100,000 people) are widely used . ( Note: See box below for more context. ) The chief justice has in the past spoken of a “recommended global percentage” of funding for the judiciary. We have contacted the judiciary for the source of the "global average" cited by the chief justice and will update this report with their response. Wachira Maina is a constitutional lawyer in Kenya who has written about the progress of institutions, including the judiciary, following the adoption of the 2010 constitution. He directed us to the UN Office of Drug and Crime (UNODC) for data on the administration of justice professionals against a country’s population. It shows there were 1.3 judges or magistrates for every 100,000 people in Kenya in 2014, 3.6 for South Africa in 2015, and 0.8 for the US and 8.7 for China in 2017. But the UNODC noted key weaknesses in the data when comparing countries. “The numbers reported are not restricted to judges deciding criminal cases,” it said. “The comparability problem might get even worse because some countries might still only report the number of judges whose duty is the judgment of criminal cases. “Apart from this, it is not clear whether really all judges are included in the reported figures in all countries.” Without a source for the chief justice’s claim of a global average, we can only rate this final claim as unproven. Is calculating the ratio of judges and magistrates to the population useful? The ratio of judges and magistrates to the population is useful depending on what you’re using it to show, Wachira Maina , a constitutional lawyer in Kenya told Africa Check. He gave an example of using the ratio of the number of doctors to the population as a metric for access to health, and of police officers to measure access to security services. However, he said, ratio data leaves a lot unstated, such as the distribution by region and by urban and rural areas. Therefore “to determine access to services, you will almost certainly need additional information”. “A high ratio by itself does not prove that most people have access to services, merely that if services were equitably distributed, and they rarely are, more people would have access,” Maina said. “Keep in mind though that you cannot increase access unless you have the numbers, so the ratio does still say something useful.” Chris Kerkering is a litigation manager at Katiba Institute , an organisation in Nairobi that promotes the knowledge of Kenya’s constitution. He told Africa Check that population does not automatically equate to a judge’s caseload. A very litigious society would have more cases per population, he said. Caseload and caseload weighting, which Kerkering described as not only counting the number of cases but also being able to determine how much time each respective case would take , may be the best way to determine whether a judiciary has the appropriate number of judges. But since doing a comparison between different countries with different legal systems and different cultures would be near impossible, “judges per population is a decent aggregate”, Kerkering said. He said the chief justice’s focus was on access to justice. “If there are not enough judges and the staff that support them then they are unable to provide the services that the judiciary requires. Case backlogs become one of the more obvious problems. Fewer judges mean that each judge is taking more cases.” “The more cases a judge has, the more time it takes to get through them. Access to justice requires timely decisions. The phrase ‘justice delayed is justice denied,’ is so commonly used for a reason. Often, as a case winds its way through the court system, avoidable delays result in long term harm.” “A judiciary that can’t get through its caseload promptly can’t ensure access to justice as required by the constitution.” Carlos Mureithi is a journalist based in Nairobi, Kenya Further reading: https://africacheck.org/reports/budget-cuts-hit-kenyas-judiciary-but-theres-no-global-funding-target/ Republish our content for free We believe that everyone needs the facts.

After the promulgation of the Constitution of Kenya in 2010, the general public, through parliament, sought to reform the judiciary. Parliament passed the Magistrates and Judges Vetting Act of 2011. A major part of reforming the judiciary was the vetting of Magistrates and Judges in an attempt to weed out unsuitable ones. The Judicature Act has also been amended to raise the minimum number of Magistrates and Judges allowing more judicial officers to be hired. More magistrates and judges are needed to clear the backlog of cases that have caused great delay in the conclusion of cases and to staff new courts. New courts are needed to bring the courts closer to the people which is in line with devolution, a major principle written into the Constitution of 2010. New courts like the High Court opened in Garissa in November 2014 is a good example. In the past residents of North Eastern Kenya had to go all the way to Embu to access a High Court. Courts [ edit ] The Judiciary of Kenya consists of three Superior courts; the Supreme Court , Court of Appeal , High Court .
